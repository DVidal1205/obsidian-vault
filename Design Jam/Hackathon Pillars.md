# The Five Pillars of Hackathons
## Community
- Teams of 1 - 4 people.
- Team Building sessions during opening for those missing a team.
- Chat thread for participants (Discord works great).
## Opportunity
- Sponsor companies are a big component, but may be difficult to obtain.
- Networking opportunities!
- Offering rewards for different categories to add incentive.
## Creativity
## Productivity
## Fun
- Theming is a big portion of the fun, perhaps Space (UCF/Nasa) or something else.
- Non-work events (MLH is infamous for cup-stacking).
