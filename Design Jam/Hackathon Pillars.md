# The Five Pillars of Hackathons
## Community
- Teams of 1 - 4 people (allow people to make their own teams).
- Team Building sessions during opening for those missing a team.
- Chat thread for participants (Discord works great).
## Opportunity
- Sponsor companies are a big component, but may be difficult to obtain.
- Networking opportunities!
- Offering rewards for different categories to add incentive.
## Creativity
- Have various categories to inspire the production process.
- Offer resources to build a project with if needed (hardware).
- Allow for project demos during judging to allow for presentation opportunities.
## Productivity
- Should be at least 24 hours of programming time to expect a product rather than a concept.
- No work gets done on an empty stomach.
- Make sure there is ample seating and room to relax/sleep if needed.
- Access to the internet and power is a must.
- Good communication via email or Discord.
- Smooth submission process through a platform like Devpost.
- Access to technical mentorship is a plus.
- Optional workshops with technologies.
## Fun
- Theming is a big portion of the fun, perhaps Space (UCF/Nasa) or something else.
- Consistent decor across flyers, venue, etc. 
- Non-work events (MLH is infamous for cup-stacking).
- Project judging should be concluded before leaving to allow for an awards presentation.
- Optional merchandise adds to the fun (shirts, pencils, etc)
# Things to consider...
## Scalability
- How big are we willing to make this?
- Should this be private to UCF students, or open to the public via Devpost threads?
- What is the capacity of where we would host it?
