# Section 12.2 - Vectors in Three Dimensions
## Learning Objectives
- - 2.2.1 Describe three-dimensional space mathematically.
- 2.2.2 Locate points in space using coordinates.
- 2.2.3 Write the distance formula in three dimensions.
- 2.2.4 Write the equations for simple planes and spheres.
- 2.2.5 Perform vector operations in $R^{3}$.
### Three-Dimensional Coordinate Systems
By introducing another value and plane, the $z$ plane, we can create a rectangular three-dimensional plane. Sketching this 3D plane requires the knowledge of the **right-hand rule**, which states the positive X axis is in the direction of your fingers outwards, the positive Y axis is in the direction of your fingers curled in, and the positive Z axis is in the direction of your thumb.

This new plane is separated by perpendicular planes, the $xz$ plane, the $yz$ plane, and the $xy$ plane. These planes separate the space into **octants**

### The Equation of a Sphere
Similar to the equation for a circle, the formula for a three-dimensional sphere is the following:

#### Finding the Equation of a Sphere
Given the center and a point on the sphere:
1. Calculate the radius by computing the distance between the point and the center
2. Use the standard equation of a sphere with the new found radius and center
### Three Dimensional Vectors
Placed in $R^{3}$, a vector $v = <x, y, z>$, similar to the two-dimensional plane.
### Three Dimensional Standard-Unit Vectors
$<x, y, z> = xi + yj + zk$
