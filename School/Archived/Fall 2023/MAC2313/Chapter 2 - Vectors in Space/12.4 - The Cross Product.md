# Section 12.4 - The Cross Product
## Learning Objectives
- 2.4.1 Calculate the cross product of two given vectors.
- 2.4.2 Use determinants to calculate a cross product.
- 2.4.3 Find a vector orthogonal to two given vectors.
- 2.4.4 Determine areas and volumes by using the cross product.
- 2.4.5 Calculate the torque of a given force and position vector.
### The Cross Product
- Multiplies 2 Vectors and returns a Vector perpendicular to both vectors.
