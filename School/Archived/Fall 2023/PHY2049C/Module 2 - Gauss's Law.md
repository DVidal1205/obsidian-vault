# Gauss's Law
**Electric Flux:** the product of the magnitude of the electric field and the surface area, A, perpendicular to the field
$\phi_{E} = EA$
Units: $\frac{Nm^{2}}{C}$
- The electric flux is proportional to the number of electric field lines penetrating some surface
- The field lines may have some angle $\theta$ with the perpendicular to the surface
- $\phi_{E} = EA\cos{\theta}$
- A maximum flux has a $\theta = 0\degree$, and flux is 0 when $\theta = 90\degree$
### Non Uniform Shape Flux
#### Closed Surface
$\phi_{E} = \int_{surface}{\overrightarrow{E} * d\overrightarrow{A}}$
### Gauss Theorem
$\phi_{closed} = \frac{q_{in}}{E_{0}}$
