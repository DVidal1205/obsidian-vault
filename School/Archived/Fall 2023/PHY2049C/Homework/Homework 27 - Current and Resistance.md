- To get the Current I, find Q/t
	- Q is the charge, so the number of electrons time the charge of an electron
	- In this case it is 24C (1.5 x 10^20) + (1.6 x 10^-19)
	- I = 24/4.5 = 5.33333A
- To get the Area of the cross section, find $\pi r^2$

## Question 2
How long does it take for a mole of electrons to travel through a cross section of the wire?
![[Pasted image 20230929210737.png]]
- Gold Wire n = 5.9 x 10^28
- A = pi0.0005^2
- drift = 5.5 x 10^-5
- mole = 6.023 x 10^23

## Question 3
a. What is the Drift Speed?
b. What is the mean time between collisions?
![[Pasted image 20230929212023.png]]
### Part A
$v_{d} = \frac{\left( 3.8*10^{17} \frac{electrons}{sec} \right)}{(6.00*10^{28}m^{-3})(A\mathrm{re}a)}$
### Part B
![[Pasted image 20230929212515.png]]
- Weight x Area / Charge x Voltage

## Question 4
a. What is the current density in the filament?
b. What is the electron current in the filament?

### Part A
- Find I / A = 0.650 / pi r squared
### Part B
Find I / n

## Question 5
a. What is the electric field in the wire?
b. What is the electron drift speed in the wire?
![[Pasted image 20230929213722.png]]
### Part A
E = l x I/A volts per meter
l = 1.59 x 10^-8 for silver (resistivity)
### Part B
Vd = (I/A * n * e)
n = 5.8 x 10^28 
e = electron charge

## Question 6
What is the wire's resistivity?
![[Pasted image 20230929214330.png]]
E = p x I/A
row = (E x A) / I

## Question 7
Not doing all that

## Question 8
Same here

## Question 9
a. What is the current in the 2mm segment of the wire?
b. What is the electron drift speed in the 2mm diameter segment of the wire?
