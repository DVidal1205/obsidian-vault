# Electric Charge and Matter
## Big Picture
Electron is both conserved and quantized
- Conserved: Electric Charge in the universe remains constant
- Quantized: Electric Charge is measured in standard units of charge, both the proton and electron force, and cannot be divided into half of a standard charge
The electron carries a negative ( - ) charge and a proton carries a positive ( + )
- Electron: $-1.6 * 10^{-19}$
- Protons: $1.6 * 10^{-19}$

## Conductors, Insulators, Semiconductors
**Conductors:** Materials where the outer electrons of the atoms are free to move from atom to atom, "Free Body Electrons." When a good conductor is charged in a small region, it will distribute over the surface of the substance.
- Metals, such as Copper, Aluminum, and Silver

**Insulators:** Electrons are associated with a particular atom, with very few electrons moving freely in an insulator.
- Wood, Glass, Rubber

**Semiconductors:** Contain some free electrons and their properties are in between those of conductors and insulators. Their electric properties are malleable with introduction of other chemicals or atoms, aka circuitry.
- Germanium, Silicon

## Charging Various Objects
1. Rubbing one object against another will cause electrons to move from one to another. Total charge is conserved
2. **Induction:** placing a conductor next to a charged object, which creates the following effect, which also works inversely in the presence of a negatively charged rod:

3. **Polarization:** Positioning an insulator near external charge will disturb the geometry, and the electrons will try to separate from the nucleus, creating a positive and negative polar end, known as a dipole. Insulator attractive forces are much lighter.
	1. An electron has a charge $-q$
	2. A proton has a charge $+q$
	3. The dipoles are separated by a distance $d$
	4. The electric dipole moment is:  $\overrightarrow{p}$
	5. $|\overrightarrow{p}| = |q| * d$

## Charles Coulomb
June 14, 1736
Worked on the formula for friction during his time in the army: 
$F_{k} = \mu N$
### Coulombs Law
$F_{e} = K_{e} \frac{|q1||q2|}{r^{2}}$
$K_{e} = 9 * 10^{9} \frac{Nm^{2}}{C^{2}}$
## Electric Field
$\overrightarrow{F}q = q \overrightarrow{E}(v)$
- Parallel to the electric field if q > 0
- Antiparallel to the electric field if q < 0
- The magnitude of the vectors of an electric field are $\frac{K_{e}Q}{r}$
- Negative electric field travels towards the center, or the **source charge*** (sinks)
- Radial
- Points from + to -
## Conductors in Electric Fields
- Placing a conductor in an external electric field, freely moving charges in the conductor will re-distribute on the conductor surface until the total (external + induced) electric field in the conduction is -
	- Conductors are Electric Field Shields
	- Surface
## Insulators in Electric Fields
- Due to dipole moments, insulators do not shield
