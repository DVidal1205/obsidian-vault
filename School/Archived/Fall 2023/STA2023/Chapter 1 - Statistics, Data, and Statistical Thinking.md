# Chapter 1 - Statistics, Data, and Statistical Thinking
## Section 1.1 - The Science of Statistics
**Statistics:** the science that deals with the collection, classification, analysis, and interpretation of information or data.

## Section 1.2 - Types of Statistical Applications
- **Descriptive Statistics:** utilizes numerical and graphical methods to look for patterns in a data set, to summarize the information revealed in a data set, and to present that information in a convenient form.
- **Inferential Statistics:** utilizes sample data to make estimates, decisions, predictions, or other generalization about a larger set of data.

## Section 1.3 - Fundamental Elements of Statistics
- **Experimental, or Observational Unit:** an object about which data is collected
- **Population:** a set of all units that are the interests of the study (Parameter: a description of a population characteristic)
	- **Sample:** a subset, or part of the population (Statistic: a numerical description of a sample characteristic)
- **Variable:** a characteristic or property of an individual experimental unit in the population
- **Measurement:** the process used to assign numbers to variables of individual population units
	- **Census:** The measure of a variable for every unit of a population
## Section 1.4 - Types of Data
- **Quantitative Data:** data that are measured on a naturally occurring numerical scale
	- **Interval Data:** the origin of the data is not a meaningful number. Can be added and subtracted, but not multiplied
	- **Ratio Data:** the origin of the data is a meaningful number
	- Example: The temperature at which each piece in a sample of 20 pieces of heat-resistant plastic bags begin to melt (Interval Data)
	- Example: The current unemployment rate (as a percentage) in each of the 50 states (Ratio Data)
- **Qualitative/Categorical Data:** measurements that cannot be measured on a natural numerical scale; only classified into one of a group of categories
	- **Nominal Data:** Unordered categories
	- **Ordinal Data:** Ordered Categories
	- Example: The political party affiliation in a sample of 50 voters (Nominal Data)
	- Example: The size of a car rented by each of a sample of 30 business travelers (Ordinal Data)
## Section 1.5 - Collecting Data: Sampling and Related Issues
**Designed Experiment:** a data collection method where the researcher exerts full control over the characteristics of the experimental units sampled, with an experimental and a control group.
**Observational Study:** an experiment that occurs in the subjects natural environment observationally. The researcher takes no control of environmental factors.
**Representative Sample:** exhibits characteristics typical of those possessed by the target population.
- **Stratified:** organized by characteristic - survey of issues between republicans and democrats
- **Clustered:** grouping sample groups and drawing conclusions - surveyed city blocks or planes
- **Systemic Sampling:** sampling every $n$th unit of a population
