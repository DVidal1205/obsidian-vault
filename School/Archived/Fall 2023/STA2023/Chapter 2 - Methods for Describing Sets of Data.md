# Chapter 2 - Methods of Describing Sets of Data
## Section 2.1 - Describing Qualitative Data
- **Class:** one of the categories into which qualitative data can be classified
- **Class Frequency:** the number of observations in the data set that fall into a particular class
- **Class Relative Frequency:** the class frequency divided by the total number of observations ($\frac{class frequency}{n}$)
- **Class Percentage:** class relative frequency multiplied by 100 ($\frac{class frequency}{n} * 100$)
## Section 2.2 - Graphical Methods of Describing Quantitative Data
- **Dot Plots:** a dot like distribution of measurements across a scaling axis

- **Stem and Leaf Display:** a graph of a stem, or portion of the measurement on the left of the decimal, and the leaf, or the value to the right of the decimal

- **Histogram:** the horizontal axis is divided into class intervals (Ex. 30-31mpg, 44-45mpg)

## Section 2.3 - Numerical Measures of Central Tendencies
- **Central Tendency:** the tendency of the data to cluster, or center, about certain numerical values
- **Variability:** the spread of data about the Central Tendency
- **Mean:** a set of quantitative data is the sum of the measurements, divided by the number of measurements contained in the data set
	- $\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}}{n}$
	- $\bar{x}$ = Sample Mean
	- $\mu$ = Population Mean
- **Median:** the middle number when the measurements are arranged
	- If n is odd, M is the middle number
	- If n is even, M is the mean of the middle two numbers
	- $M$ = Sample Median
	- $\eta$ = Population Median
- **Skewed Data:** skewed if one tail of the distribution has more extreme observations than the other tail (If the median is different from the mean)
- **Mode:** the measurement that occurs most frequently within the data set
## Section 2.4 - Numerical Measures of Variability
- **Range:** equal to the largest measurement minus the smallest measurement
- **Sample Variance:** Equal to the sum of the squared deviations from the mean, n-1.
	- $s^{2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{2}}{n-1}$s
	- Population Sample Variance: $\sigma^{2}$
	- ![[Pasted image 20230828155216.png]]
- **Sample Standard Deviation:** the positive square root of sample variance
	- $s = \sqrt{{s^{2}}}$
	- Population Standard Deviation: $\sigma$
## Section 2.5 - Using the Mean and Standard Deviation to Describe Data
### Rule 2.1 - Chebyshev's Rule
1. It is possible that very few of the measurements will fall within one standard deviation of the mean ($\bar{x}-s, \bar{x}+s$)
2. At least $\frac{3}{4}$ of the measurements will fall within two standard deviations of the mean ($\bar{x}-2s, \bar{x}+2s$)
3. At least $\frac{8}{9}$ of the measurements will fall within three standard deviations of the mean ($\bar{x}-3s, \bar{x}+3s$)
4. Generally, for any number $k$ greater than 1, at least ($\frac{1-1}{k^2}$)
### Rule 2.2 - The Empirical Rule
1. Approximately 68% will fall within one standard deviation of the mean ($\bar{x}-s, \bar{x}+s$)
2. Approximately 95% will fall within two standard deviations of the mean ($\bar{x}-2s, \bar{x}+2s$)
3. Approximately 99.7% will fall within three standard deviations of the mean ($\bar{x}-3s, \bar{x}+3s$)
## Section 2.6 - Numerical Measures of Relative Standing
**Measure of Relative Standing:** a descriptive measure of the relationship of a measurement to the rest of the data
- **Percentile Ranking/Score:** a type of measure of relative standing
- **Lower Quartile:** the 25th percentile of the data set
- **Middle Quartile:** The median or 50th percentile
- **Upper Quartile:** the 75th percentile
- **Z-score:** $z= \frac{x-\bar{x}}{s}$
1. Approximately 68% will have a z-score between -1 and 1
2. Approximately 95% will have a z-score between -2 and 2
3. Approximately 99.7% will have a z-score between -3 and 3
