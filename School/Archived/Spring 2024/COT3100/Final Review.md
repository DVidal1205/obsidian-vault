1. There are 805 lockers in the athletic center and 4026 students who need lockers. Some must share lockers. What is the largest number of students who must necessarily share a locker. (6, since ceil 4026/805)
2. What is the coefficient of x^2y^7 in (x+y)^9 (C(9,2) = C(9,7) since we choose 2 x or 7 y, which is 36)
3. How many ways are there to choose five doughnuts if there are eight varieties (C(12, 5), n+r-1, r)
4. How many different string can be made using all the letters in the world GOOGOL (6!/3!2! - 6! is the total combinations, but we must remove each placement of O (3!) and G (2!) since they are technically the same)
5. Suppose that two cards are drawn without replacement from a well-shuffled deck. What is the probability that both cards have numbers on the cards are the same (36/52 - numbers * 3/51 - remaining cards with same number)
6. A computer picks out a random sequence of six digits:
	1. What is the probability that a person picks all six digits in a correct position (1/10^6)
	2. What is the probability that a person picks exactly five of the digits in the correct order (6 * 9/10^6 - there are 6 positions, and each position has 9 different options since 1 is wrong)
7. What is the probability that a group of 200 random people, at least two of them have the same triple of initials assuming that each triple of initials are equally likely. (1- 17576/17576 * 17575/17576 * 17574/17576 ... * 17576-199/17576)
