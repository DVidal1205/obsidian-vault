# Section 2.1 - Vectors in the Plane
## Learning Objectives
- 2.1.1 Describe a plane vector, using correct notation.
- 2.1.2 Perform basic vector operations (scalar multiplication, addition, subtraction).
- 2.1.3 Express a vector in component form.
- 2.1.4 Explain the formula for the magnitude of a vector.
- 2.1.5 Express a vector in terms of unit vectors.
- 2.1.6 Give two examples of vector quantities.
### Vector Representation
Vectors have an initial point and a terminal point. An arrow from the initial point to the terminal point indicates the direction of a vector. The magnitude of a vector $v$ is notated as $||v||$. 

Equivalent vectors are equal if they have the same direction and magnitude

### Combining Vectors
#### Scalar Multiplication
The product $kv$ of a vector $v$ and a scalar $k$ is a vector with a magnitude that is $|k|$ times the magnitude of $v$, and with a direction that is the same as the direction of $v$ if $k > 0$ and opposite the direction of $v$ if $k < 0$. This is called scalar multiplication. If $k=0$ or $v=0$, then $kv = 0$.
#### Vector Addition
Using the tail to tip method, you may add two vectors graphically. By placing a vectors terminal point on another's initial point, the resultant vector of the addition is from one terminal to the other initial point.

### Vector Notation
#### Component Form
The component form of a vector with an initial point at (0,0) is denoted as $v = <x, y>$, or the horizontal and vertical distance of the vector.

### Standard Unit Vectors
- The vectors $i = <1,0>$ and $j=<0,1>$
- $w = <3, -4> = 3i - 4j$
### Magnitude of a Vector
$||v|| = \sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}$
### Trigonometric Component Form

$i = ||v||cos\theta, j = ||v||sin\theta$
### Finding a Unit Vector
1. Find the Magnitude of the Vector
2. Divide all components by the magnitude of the vector
### Finding a Vector in the same direction and different Magnitude
1. $||v|| = |k|*||u||$
2. $|k| = \frac{||v||}{||u||}$
3. Multiply each component of $v$ by $k$
