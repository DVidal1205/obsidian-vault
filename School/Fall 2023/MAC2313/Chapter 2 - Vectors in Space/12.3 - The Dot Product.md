### Dot Product
Takes two vectors and returns a scalar.
Given two vectors, $\overrightarrow{u}$ and $\overrightarrow{v}$ , $\overrightarrow{u}$ * $\overrightarrow{v}$  = $|\overrightarrow{u}| *|\overrightarrow{v}|\cos{\theta}$ where $\theta$ is the angle between $\overrightarrow{u}$ and $\overrightarrow{v}$
### Projection
- Projections take two vectors and give back a vector

### Angle Between Two Vectors
$\theta = \cos^{-1}{\frac{a * b}{||a|| * ||b||}}$
