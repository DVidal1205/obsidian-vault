### Card Combinatorics
$\frac{13 * C(4, 2)}{C(52, 2)}$
- There are 13 suits of cards, and there are 4 of each card. We only need 2, hence the C(4,2)
- In the denominator is our number of possible experiments, which is of 52 cards picking two, hence the C(52, 2)
- C notation means $C(x, y) = \frac{x *x-1}{y}$
