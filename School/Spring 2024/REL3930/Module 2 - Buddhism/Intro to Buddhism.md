### Basic Facts
- One of the five major world religions (Hindu, Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Judaism)
- It began with Siddhartha Guatama who lived in the 6th century
- Began in India as a part of renunciate culture which aimed for freedom from the cycle of rebirth
- Theravada, Mahayana, Vajrayana
### Three Forms/Turnings
- Theravada (Teaching of Elders): Earliest group taught in Pali and was an oral tradition. New conception of the historic Buddha to multiple Buddhas. Protectors of the "true" Buddha and are 18 communities claiming they know the true teachings the closest. Also sectarian. Desire is bad.
- Mahayana (Great Vehicle): Arises around 100 CE and follows Mahayana Sutras (Sanskrit). 
- Vajrayana:
### Abrahamic versus Asian
- Abrahamic asserts that time is linear as an arrow is.
- Asian religions assert time is cyclical.
### Cosmological Frameworks
- 6 Realms of Existence: Samsara
- Karma: Action which determines your position in Samsara and the realms
- Liberation: Freedom from cyclic existence (Nibbana/Nirvana).
- Human realm is the best as we have a balance of pleasure and suffering that inspires motivation for good Karma to go to the pleasure realms. Reincarnation is a problem though, as Karma runs out.
- Renouncers: Those who left the Karma cycle to find liberation.
### Life of the Buddha
- Buddha was born to royalty, which was aristocratic families and resulting multiple kingdoms.
- His father consulted an astrologer before the birth, and was told of a son who could be a great king of the Shakya Clan or might become a renunciate.
- Will never expose his son to anything bad to stop the renunciate culture, but his mother dies.
- Siddhartha Guatama of the Shakya Clan lives the best hedonistic life and has a grand selection of women, but settles down and has a son.
- Gets bored of the good life and has his attendant sneak him outside of the palace walls.
### The Four Sights
- The sights the Buddha sees outside of the walls.
1. An old man who has aged poorly, which shocked the Buddha as he realized that will happen to him eventually.
2. A sick man with leprosy, which freaks out the Buddha as he can get sick too.
3. A dead mans corpse, which terrifies the Buddha as he can die too.
4. A renunciate, which shocks the Buddha as the renunciate is entirely void of the carnage with a grand aura of calmness.
### Renunciate Misogyny
- Get rid of women, which are the body of pleasure, we can live pleasure free.
- Tells his wife and kid in sleeping that he will not return until he finds liberation, leaving his hair and clothes behind.
- Living on one grain of rice a day.
- The Milk Maid offers him milk, and he takes it.
- Touches the Earth and says he is not getting up from his tree until he finds enlightenment. (Women positive and women are associated with the Earth, which is problematic essentialism)
