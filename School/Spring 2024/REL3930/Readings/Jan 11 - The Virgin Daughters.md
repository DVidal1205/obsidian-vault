### Descriptive Message
The Purity Ball is a ritualistic dance to reinforce purity and sainthood in young Christian girls. This event occurs as young as five years old, and is meant to establish a strong connection with their femininity and validation. This ball involves the father heavily as believers in the purity movement claim that the fathers involvement prevents any seeking of validation externally.

Throughout the documentary, the claim of the fatherly validation seems to have some validity as we go from family to family involved in the purity ball.
