### Descriptive Message
The Purity Ball is a ritualistic dance to reinforce purity and sainthood in young Christian girls. This event occurs as young as five years old, and is meant to establish a strong connection with their femininity and validation. This ball involves the father heavily as believers in the purity movement claim that the fathers involvement prevents any seeking of validation externally.

Throughout the documentary, the claim of the fatherly validation seems to have some validity as we go from family to family involved in the purity ball.

### Third Person Analysis
It goes without saying that this ritual is a bit off putting. My first conclusion was that this ritual was largely targeted towards the girls, and not so much the men. When interviewing the people in the documentary, most of the men had lived promiscuous lives and were quickly offset by families, whereas an accidental pregnancy ended in a severance of communication. The Purity Ball is entirely patriarchal, which is further reinforced by the fathers tyrannical role in the process. While there is nothing wrong with looking up to your father, being required to answer to him for all aspects of living is another thing. Lastly, this ritual most definitely reinforces heteronormative standards that are pushed by the church, as the language is entirely deterministic of a heterosexual marriage. 

### Affective Reflection
The way the families interacted with one another in the video made me feel very unsettled. It feels like a fa√ßade that could fall apart in a second, and is extremely authoritative over the lives of everyone involved. It is natural to want those you love to avoid mistakes, but it is unfair to expect them not to. Life is growing, and there is no growth without setback. The way the fathers would look at their daughters and wives demandingly, expecting what the right thing to say in the moment was, was not something I was a fan of.
