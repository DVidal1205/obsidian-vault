### Descriptive Message
The Purity Ball is a ritualistic dance to reinforce purity and sainthood in young Christian girls. This event occurs as young as five years old, and is meant to establish a strong connection with their femininity and validation. This ball involves the father heavily as believers in the purity movement claim that the fathers involvement prevents any seeking of validation externally.
