## Photosynthesis
**Light** energy converted to **Chemical** energy.
### Summary Equation
6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light Energy -> C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O
- Oxidized = Losing Electrons
- Reduced = Gaining Electrons
- Reactant H2O: Oxidized
- CO2: Reduced
- **Photosynthesis does not turn CO2 into O2**, the O2 created is from the Oxidized H2O
- **Anabloc Pathway that requires energy**
### Autotroph
- Convert inorganic carbon to organic
- Producers
- Photoautotrophs use light energy
### Heterotroph
- Get organic material from other organisms
