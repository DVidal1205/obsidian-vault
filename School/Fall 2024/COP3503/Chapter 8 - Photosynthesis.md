## Photosynthesis
**Light** energy converted to **Chemical** energy.
### Summary Equation
6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light Energy -> C6H12O6 + 6 O2 + 6 H2O
- Oxidized = Losing Electrons
- Reduced = Gaining Electrons
- Reactant H2O: Oxidized
- CO2: Reduced
- **Photosynthesis does not turn CO2 into O2**, the O2 created is from the Oxidized H2O
- **Anabloc Pathway that requires energy**
### Autotroph
- Convert inorganic carbon to organic
- Producers
- Photoautotrophs use light energy
### Heterotroph
- Get organic material from other organisms
### Anatomy of  a Chloroplast
- Where you see green
- Thylakoid: Phospholipid Bilayer
- Stomata: Entrance and Exit for Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide 
- Granum: Space between the outer membrane
- Green is the only light NOT used
### Stages of Photosynthesis
#### Light Reactions
- Occur in the Thylakoid Membranes
- Splits water
- Releases Oxygen
- Produces ATP & NADPH
	- ATP is made in House and USED in the Chloroplast to keep photosynthesis going
	- NADPH is the electron shuttle in Photosynthesis
#### Calvin Cycle
- Occurs in the Stroma
- Forms sugar from CO2
- Uses ATP and NADPH from light reactions
#### Relationship
- Light gives ATP and NADPH (non-oxidized) to Calvin. Light + H2O Input
- Calvin gives NADP+ and ADP + P to Light. CO2 Input
