Most applicable in bioinformatics and genetics. A sub-sequence are letters that do not have to be adjacent, just in that order.
- A**C**CG**GT**
- GT**CGT**T
- Sub-sequence CGT with a value of 3

Given a sequence X = <X1, X2, X3, ... , Xm> and a sequence Z = <Z1, Z2, Z3, ... , Zk> we can say a sub-sequence exists if there is a strictly increasing sequence I = <I1, I2, I3, ... , Ik>.
