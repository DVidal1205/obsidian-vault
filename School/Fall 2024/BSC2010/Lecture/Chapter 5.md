# Structure & Function of Plasma Membranes
The phospholipid bilayer, which serves as a gate in and out of the cell.
## Cell Membrane Components & Structure
The plasma membrane is *selectively permeable* meaning that the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell.
### The fluid mosaic model

- Lipids (phospholipids, cholesterol, and carbohydrates)
### Phospholipids
- The water loving ends of the molecules rush to the water, and the hydrophobic ends align to create a bilayer wall.
### Proteins
- Integral proteins, or integrins, integrate into the membrane in small regions and create ports.
- Peripheral proteins are on the membrane, whether interior or exterior, to serve as enzymes rather than a port.
## Environments
**Hypertonic Environment**
- Solute Outside > Solute Inside
- Net water movement *OUT* of the cell
**Hypotonic Environment**
- Solute Outside < Solute Inside
- Net water movement *IN* of the cell
### Effects on Red Blood Cells
- Hypotonic cell fills with water and explodes, creating a Lysed cell
- Isotonic cell is normal and chill
- Hypertonic cell is shriveled or suffers crenation
### Effects on Plant Cells
- Hypotonic cells are turgid normal and firm due to the pressure from the central vacuole and cell wall holding it upright
- Isotonic cells become flaccid
- Hypertonic cells lose their membrane as it shrinks and shrivels and becomes plasmolyzed
## Active Transport
Wanting to keep a specific concentration requires active transport, and needs energy supplied by ATP.
