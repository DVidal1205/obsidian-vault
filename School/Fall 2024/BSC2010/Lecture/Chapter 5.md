# Structure & Function of Plasma Membranes
The phospholipid bilayer, which serves as a gate in and out of the cell.
## Cell Membrane Components & Structure
The plasma membrane is *selectively permeable* meaning that the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell.
### The fluid mosaic model

- Lipids (phospholipids, cholesterol, and carbohydrates)
### Phospholipids
- The water loving ends of the molecules rush to the water, and the hydrophobic ends align to create a bilayer wall.
### Proteins
- Integral proteins, or integrins, integrate into the membrane in small regions and create ports.
- Peripheral proteins are on the membrane, whether interior or exterior, to serve as enzymes rather than a port.
### Carbohydrates
- Serves as a way to recognize incoming and outgoing substances.

### Environments
**Hypertonic Environment**
- Solute Outside > Solute Inside
- Net water movement *OUT* of the cell
**Hypotonic Environment**
- Solute Outside < Solute Inside
- Net water movement *IN* of the cell
### Effects on Red Blood Cells
- Hypotonic cell fills with water and explodes, creating a Lysed cell
- Isotonic cell is normal and chill
- Hypertonic cell is shriveled or suffers crenation
### Effects on Plant Cells
- Hypotonic cells are turgid normal and firm due to the pressure from the central vacuole and cell wall holding it upright
- Isotonic cells become flaccid
- Hypertonic cells lose their membrane as it shrinks and shrivels and becomes plasmolyzed
### Active Transport
Wanting to keep a specific concentration requires active transport, and needs energy supplied by ATP.

## Passive Transport
Plasma membranes allow certain substances to enter and leave a cell, as well as prevent harmful material from entering and essential materials leaving.
### Selective Permeability
- Plasma membranes are asymmetric
	- Inside: proteins serve as an anchor between the membrane and cytoskeleton
	- Outside: peripheral proteins that bind extracellular matrix elements, as well as carbs, lipids, and proteins.
- Amphiphillic - hydrophillic exterior and hydrophobic interior.
	- Non-polar and lipid-soluble material with low molecular weight can enter, but may get stuck within the membrane.
	- Polar substances present problems for the membrane and cannot pass through. Ions also have trouble passing through due to the charge.
### Diffusion
- One of the **passive process** of transports. A single substance moves from a high concentration to a low concentration area until the concentration is equal.
- Opening a bottle of ammonia in a room, it will disperse to the low concentration area.
- Diffusion **expends no energy**
#### Factors that effect diffusion
- **Temperature:** higher temperature increases the energy and movement, increasing the diffusion rate
- **Mass:** heavier molecules move slower and decrease the diffusion rate
- **Concentration Gradient:** the greater the difference, the more rapid the diffusion. Closer to equilibrium diffuses slower
- **Solvent Density:** as the density of the solvent increases, it is harder to move and diffusion rate decreases
### Facilitated Transport
- Materials diffuse with the help of membrane proteins.
- A concentration gradient exists, but the materials are polar or ions that the hydrophobic parts repel. Proteins shield the material from the repulsive force
- Attach to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior, and then pass to specific integral proteins that allow passage.
- Pore or channel, or carrier proteins
#### Channels
- Proteins create a hydrophillic channel through the core and provides a hydrated opening in the membrane.
- Aquaporins are channels that allow water to pass in a high rate
- Open at all times are are gated by particular ions.
#### Carrier Proteins
- Binds to a substance, changing its shape, and moving the molecule inside the interior. Typically specific for a single substance.
