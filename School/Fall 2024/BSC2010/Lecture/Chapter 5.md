# Structure & Function of Plasma Membranes
The phospholipid bilayer, which serves as a gate in and out of the cell.
## Cell Membrane Components & Structure
The plasma membrane is *selectively permeable* meaning that the membrane allows some materials to freely enter or leave the cell.
### The fluid mosaic model


## Environments
**Hypertonic Environment**
- Solute Outside > Solute Inside
- Net water movement *OUT* of the cell
**Hypotonic Environment**
- Solute Outside < Solute Inside
- Net water movement *IN* of the cell
### Effects on Red Blood Cells
- Hypotonic cell fills with water and explodes, creating a Lysed cell
- Isotonic cell is normal and chill
- Hypertonic cell is shriveled or suffers crenation
### Effects on Plant Cells
- Hypotonic cells lo
