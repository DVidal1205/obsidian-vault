## Mitosis
- First Gap Phase (G1), Synthesis Phase, Second Gap Phase (G2)
- Karyokinesis Subphases
	- Prophase
	- Prometaphase
	- Metaphase
	- Anaphase
	- Telophase
	- Cytokinesis
### Prophase
- An early mitotic spindle occurs between the centrioome/centriole pairs
- Centrosomes are cylinder pairs
- Chromosomes condense in the Centromere and create the sister chromatids
### Prometaphase
- The nuclear envelope is gone and fragmented
- The centrosome end up on both ends of the cell and  form kinetochore
- The sister chromatids connect to a kinetochore to each of the centrioles via the microtubules
### Metaphase
- All of the sister chromatids will be att
