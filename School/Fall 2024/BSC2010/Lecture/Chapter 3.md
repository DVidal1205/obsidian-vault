# Biological Macro-molecules
While there are the same few base elements, the Tetravalence property of Carbon allows for many different atomic structures and complexity, which is what creates biological complexity

## Polymers
- Repeating sub units of Monomers
- **Dehydration Reaction:** sacrificing a OH and Hydrogen end of monomers, creating a longer polymer and water as a byproduct
- **Hydrolysis:** using water to break apart polymers
## Sugars/Carbs/Monosaccharides
- **1:2:1 ratio of C:H:O**
- **Trioses** - three carbon sugars
- **Pentoses** - five carbon sugars
- **Hexoses** - six carbon sugars (glucose, galactose, fructose)
## Polysaccharides
- 3 ore more Monosaccharides, and serves as a storage of chemical energy and structural support
- **Starch**: glucose monomers used by plants
- **Glycogen** chained glucose monomers used by animals
- **Cellulose** strands of glucose monomers present in plants
## Lipids
- Hydrophobic and no Monomers
- Butters and oils
- Saturated fats are bad fats (meat, butter, etc)
	- Lots of Hydrogen, no double bonds
	- Tight straight lines, can be solid at room temperature
- Unsaturated fats are good fats (avocado, salmon, oil)
	- Does not increase the pressure in arteries as much
	- Double carbon bond
