# Metabolism
## Energy and Metabolism
Every task performed by living organisms require energy to synthesize and deconstruct molecules. The cellular process of creating energy is metabolism, and a subset of bioenergetics.
Most lifeforms on Earth get their energy from the sun. Plants use photosynthesis, herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat herbivores, and decomposers eat the remains.
### Carbohydrate Metabolism
Sugar metabolism is a classic example of the many cellular processes that use and produce energy.
Living things use sugar as a major energy source.

These simple sugars are created by photosynthesizing organisms like plants, which require the energy input of the sun to accomplish.

During photosynthesis, energy is in the form of a high-energy molecule called ATP, or adenosine triphospohate. This is the "currency" of energy in cells.
### Metabolic Pathways
Making and breaking sugar molecules illustrates two types of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway is a series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule into a final product or result.
### Anabolic & Catabolic
- Anabolic pathways require an *input* of energy to *synthesize* complex molecules from simpler ones
- Catabolic pathways *output* energy b
