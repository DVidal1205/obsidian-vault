# Metabolism
## Energy and Metabolism
Every task performed by living organisms require energy to synthesize and deconstruct molecules. The cellular process of creating energy is metabolism, and a subset of bioenergetics.
Most lifeforms on Earth get their energy from the sun. Plants use photosynthesis, herbivores eat plants, carnivores eat herbivores, and decomposers eat the remains.
### Carbohydrate Metabolism
Sugar metabolism is a classic example of the many cellular processes that use and produce energy.
Living things use sugar as a major energy source.

These simple sugars are created by photosynthesizing organisms like plants, which require the energy input of the sun to accomplish.

During photosynthesis, energy is in the form of a high-energy molecule called ATP, or adenosine triphospohate. This is the "currency" of energy in cells.
### Metabolic Pathways
Making and breaking sugar molecules illustrates two types of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway is a series of interconnected biochemical reactions that convert a substrate molecule into a final product or result.
### Anabolic & Catabolic
- Anabolic pathways require an *input* of energy to *synthesize* complex molecules from simpler ones
- Catabolic pathways *output* energy by breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones
All metabolic pathway chemical reactions do not take place spontaneously and will require the presence of an enzyme.
## Energy
Energy is the ability to do work, and exists in many forms, all critical to metabolism.
### Energy Types
**Potential Energy:** energy from positioning and the ability to do work
**Kinetic energy:** the energy of motion
**Chemical Energy:** potential energy stored within chemical bonds
### Free Energy
After learning that chemical reactions have energy, how do we quantify and express the chemical reactions with associated energy. The measurement of free energy to quantitative these energy transfers is called Gibbs free energy
## Endergonic and Exergonic Reactions
If energy releases during a chemical reaction, $\Delta G < 0$. A negative $\Delta G$ means the products have *less* free energy than the reactants, because energy was given off energy. This is *exergonic*, since energy is *exiting* the system. 
Positive G means it needs energy, negative G means it loses energy.
