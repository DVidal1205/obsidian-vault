# Cell Respiration
Cell Respiration is the conversion from the chemical energy stored in glucose to energy that can be used.
## Introduction
### Electrons and Energy
Energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways. Most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions.
- An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom
- A reduction reaction adds an electron to an atom
- Usually occur together and are called redox reactions
The removal of an electron results in a decrease in potential energy, and vise versa for the addition of one. The transfer of electrons between molecules causes changes in potential energy and is important because it allows cells to transfer energy.
### Electron Carriers
In living systems, a small class of compounds function as electron shuttles. **NAD+**, or Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide is derived from vitamin B3, niacin. It is the oxidized form of the molecule **NADH** after it has accepted two electrons and a proton. Additionally, **FAD+** or falvin adenine dinucleotide is derived from riboflavin and its reduced form is FADH2.
FAD+ and NAD+ are used in energy extraction from sugars and NADP plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis in plants.
### ATP Structure and Function
First it is AMP, then ADP, then ATP. These are the mono, di, and tri forms of adenosine Xpohsphate
The addition of each phosphsate group requires energy.
The hydrolysis of ATP produces ADP and inorganic phopsphate Pi, and the release of free energy.
Like a battery, ATP is broken into ADP, and ADP is regenerated into ATP
### Phosphorylation
ATP is generated through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose. ATP is broken in catabolic pathways to ADP, and the free energy created helps attach a phosphate group to ADP
Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism, however, is derived from a much more complex process called **chemiosmosis** which takes place in the mitochondria, which generates 90 percen
