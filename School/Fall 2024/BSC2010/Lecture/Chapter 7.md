# Cell Respiration
Cell Respiration is the conversion from the chemical energy stored in glucose to energy that can be used.
## Introduction
### Electrons and Energy
Energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways. Most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions.
- An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom
- A reduction reaction adds an electron to an atom
- Usually occur together and are called redox reactions
The removal of an electron results in a decrease in potential energy, and vise versa for the addition of one. The transfer of electrons between molecules causes changes in potential energy and is important because it allows cells to transfer energy.
### Electron Carriers
In living systems, a small class of compounds function as electron shuttles. **NAD+**, or Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide is derived from vitamin B3, niacin. It is the oxidized form of the molecule **NADH** after it has accepted two electrons and a proton. Additionally, **FAD+** or falvin adenine dinucleotide is derived from riboflavin and its reduced form is FADH2.
FAD+ and NAD+ are used in energy extraction from sugars and NADP plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis in plants.
### ATP Structure and Function
First it is AMP, then ADP, then ATP. These are the mono, di, and tri forms of adenosine Xpohsphate
The addition of each phosphsate group requires energy.
The hydrolysis of ATP produces ADP and inorganic phopsphate Pi, and the release of free energy.
Like a battery, ATP is broken into ADP, and ADP is regenerated into ATP
### Phosphorylation
ATP is generated through two mechanisms during the breakdown of glucose. ATP is broken in catabolic pathways to ADP, and the free energy created helps attach a phosphate group to ADP
Most of the ATP generated during glucose catabolism, however, is derived from a much more complex process called **chemiosmosis** which takes place in the mitochondria, which generates 90 percent of the ATP made during glucose catabolism. This is called oxidative phosphorylation because it requires oxygen.
## Glycolysis
Glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cellular metabolism. Nearly all living organisms carry out glycolysis. The process does not use oxygen directly and is *anaerobic* and takes place in the cytoplasm.
Glycolysis begins with a six-carbon ring-shaped structure of a single glucose and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate. The glycolysis pathway consists of two major steps.
### 1st Half of Glycolysis (energy Requiring steps)
Products of this reaction will serve as reactants for the next one. These reactions can be divided into two types, the first being investment steps, and the rest being energy releasing steps.
Two ATP molecules are needed for the first half.
At the end of the energy requiring phase, the pathway will continue with two molecules of 3-carbon sugar, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
### 2nd Half of Glycolysis
So far, it has cost two ATP molecules and produced two small three-carbon sugar molecules.Both sugar molecules will proceed through stage 2, and sufficient energy will be extracted to pay back the two ATP molecules used at the start and produce a profit with two more ATP molecules and two NADH molecules.
This depends on NAD+, which means NADH must be constantly oxidized back to NADH. If oxygen is in the system, the NADH will continue being oxidized, and the electrons released from this will produce the ATP. Without oxygen, there is an alternate pathway of fermentation which can provide oxidation from NADH to NAD+

### Glycolysis Outcome
Glycolysis begins with glucose and produces two pyruvate molecules, four ATP molecules, and two molecules of NADH. Net gain of 2 ATP since 2 were needed as inputs. These pyruvate cells may continue to make ATP if a mitochondria is present.
## Oxidation of Pyruvate and Citric Acid
If oxygen is available, aerobic respiration will go forward and the pyruvate molecules will be used by the mitochondria. Pyruvate is transformed into an acetyl group that will be picked up and activated by coenzyme A (CoA) and produced acetyl CoA, which is derived from vitamin B5.
### Breakdown of Pyruvate
Step 1. A carboxyl group is removed from pyruvate releasing a molecule of carbon dioxide. This creates a two-carbon hydroxyethyl group bound to the enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase. This step happens twice, this two of the six carbons has been removed
Step 2. The hdryoxyethyl group is oxidized into an acetyl group and electrons are picked up by NAD+, forming NADH. The high energy NADH will be used to generate ATP.
Step 3. The enzyme bound acetyl group is transferred to CoA, producing a molecule of acetyl CoA. 
The carbon released gets bound to O2, creating carbon dio
