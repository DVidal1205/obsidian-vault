# Cell Respiration
Cell Respiration is the conversion from the chemical energy stored in glucose to energy that can be used.
## Introduction
### Electrons and Energy
Energy production within a cell involves many coordinated chemical pathways. Most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions.
- An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom
- A reduction reaction adds an electron to an atom
- Usually occur together and are called redox reactions
The removal of an electron results in a decrease in potential energy, and vise versa for the addition of one. The transfer of electrons between molecules causes changes in potential energy and is important because it allows cells to transfer energy.
### Electron Carriers
In living systems, a small class of compounds function as electron shuttles. **NAD+**, or Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide is derived from vitamin B3, niacin. It is the oxidized form of the molecule **NADH** after it has accepted two electrons and a proton.
