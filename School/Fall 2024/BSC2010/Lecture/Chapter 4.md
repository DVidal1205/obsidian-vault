# Cell Structure
## Cell Theory
- 1 or more cells in all living organisms.
- All new cells come from existing cells.
## ALL CELLS
- Plasma/Cell Membrane
- Cytosol
- DNA
- Ribosomes
## Prokaryotic Cell (Bacteria & Archaea)
- Before the Nucleus (no nucleus)
	- Nucleoid
	- Ribosomes
	- Plasma Membrance
	- Cell Wall
	- Copsule
	- Flagella
## Eukaryotic Cells: Animal
- Animalia, Protista, Fungi, and Plantae
## Endomembrane System
- Things inside of the membrane
	- Nucleus
		- The center-ish of the cell and contains the DNA and protein instructions
		- Center is Nucleolus and center of the ribosome creation
	- Rough endoplasmic reticulum
		- Covered in ribosomes
	- Smooth endoplasmic reticulum
		- Not covered in ribosomes
	- cis Golgi
	- trans Golgi
## Lysosomes
- Cellular stomachs
- Phagocytosis - eating a cell
## Central Vacuole
- Plant cells have a central big membrane sack
