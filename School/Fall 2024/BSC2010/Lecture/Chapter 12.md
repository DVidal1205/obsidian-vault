# Mendel's Experiments and Heredity
Monk who discovered genetics
- **Character:** inherited traits or group of characteristics
- **Traits:**
## Mendel's Model: Concept 1
- **Alleles:** alternative versions of genes.
- The nucleotides are responsible for the encoding of enzymes. Absence of nucleotide means absence of purple enzyme
## Mendel's Model: Concept 2
- Organisms inherit 2 alleles, 1 from each parent.
## Mendel's Model: Concept 3
- Dominant allele determines appearance 
- Dominant: UPPER CASE A
- Recessive: lower case a
## Mendel's Model: Concept 4
- Law of Segregation 
- 2 alleles segregate and separate during meiosis
