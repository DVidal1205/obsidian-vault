## Isomers
- Same elements but different structural formulas. Can be a mirrored element
- **Structural Isomers** occur from branching 
- **Aldehyde** end of carbon skeleton
- **Ketone** middle of carbon skeleton
- **Ionized and Hydrophilic** when a hydrogen atom leaves its electron behind, ionizing the Carboxyl
	- Acid since it is donating the hydrogen to the environment
- **Carboxyl Group** one double bonded oxygen to a carbon
