# Photosynthesis
## Calvin Cycle
After sun energy is converted into chemical energy and stored in ATP and NADPH, the cell has the fuel needed to build carbohydrate molecules for long-term storage.
### Calvin Cycle
Carbon dioxide enters the leaves through the stomata, where it diffuses through intercellular spaces until it reaches mesophyll cells. In the mesophyll, CO2 enters the stroma of the chloroplast. Light is not required for the Calvin Cycle. Creates sugars from ATP and NADPH created by light system.
### Stage 1: Fixation
In the stroma, the RuBisCO  enzyme and three molecules of ribulose biphosphate RuBP merge with the CO2. This incorporates carbon dioxide into an organic molecule, 3-PGA. This process is called carbon fixation, because CO2 is fixed from inorganic into organic molecules.
### Stage 2: Reduction
ATP and NADH are used to convert the six molecules of 3-PHA into six molecules of G3P. This is a reduction reaction because it gains electrons. Six molecules of ATP and NADPH are used.
### Stage 3: Regeneration
Only one of the G3P molecules leave the Calvin cycle. It takes three turns of the Calvin cycle to fix enough net carbon to export one G3P, but each turn makes two G3P. Thus, three turns make six G3P. One is exported, and the remaining five G3P molecules remain in cycle to regenerate RuBP which prepares for more CO2. Three molecules of ATP are used in regeneration reactions.
## Light Dependent Reactions
### What is Light Energy
Light energies are waves of photons. Short, tight waves carry the most energy, from purple to blue. Green is not absorbed, and yellow to red is low absorption.
### Pigments
Different kinds of pigments exist and each absorb only specific wavelengths of light. **Chlorophylls and carotenoids** are two major classes of pigments in plants and algae. Chlorophyll comes in 5 types, but chlorophyll a and b are most found in chloroplasts.
### Light Dependent Reactions
The goal is to convert solar energy into NADPH and ATP to be used in the Calvin Cycle, which creates carbs. There are two photosystems, PII comes first and PI comes second.
Both systems have the same basic structure - antenna proteins to which the chlorophyll molecules are bound and the reaction center where photochemistry occurs. PSII, PSI, and the cytochrome complex make up the electron transport chain.
The reaction center of PSII, called P680, delivers high-energy electrons to the primary electron accepter. The ETC then refills the missing electron by taking a low energy electron from water, which releases two electrons, two hydrogen, and one oxygen. 10 percent of oxygen is stored for cellular respiration and 90 percent is ejected. Hydrogen are moved inside the thylakoid lumen.
