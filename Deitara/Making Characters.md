## Character Requirements
I want some specific elements for everyone and their characters, I'll go ahead and list all of them here.
- Level 3 character
- A reason to take [[Introduction|Harlon's Quest]]
- Currently live in Polithea, as well as have something in Polithea that deeply matters to your character (family, wealth, legacy, etc). You can come from another of the Five Great Nations.
- You don't have to worship a deity, but any relation to a specific deity would be kind of fun
