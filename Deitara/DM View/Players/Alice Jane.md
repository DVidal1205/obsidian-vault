A runaway Orphan from a region unknown to her. Her tiefling heritage was removed from her in the orphanage, and thus she is known as Alice Jane, given to her by the godmother. 

She wants to find her family, and her only clue is the tattoo on her neck. She gets frequent flashbacks from Polithea and her family, so thus she went there searching.

# DM Notes
She got her druidic ancestry from her parents, who are elder druids from Druvina that formed a tiefling diaspora to escape persecution. They lost Lilith after she ran off into the forest, which she was found by Druvina citizens and adopted, before quickly being given to orphanage homes and passed around the world. Thankfully, there is a program in Polithea called the Afterbirth Homes to give orphans around the world passage into Polithea. Here, she continues to search for her parents and is very curious.

Her crest may come up in the wasteland, and her mother will likely still be alive due to druidic ancestry.
