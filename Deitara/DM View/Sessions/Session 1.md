## The Apocalypse
The party will emerge from the Cathedral to a sky with 2 and a half moons, rotating in opposite directions from one another. Some of the trees will be growing upside down, with the roots beckoning to the sky. As they step out of the Cathedral, it will dramatically crumble. The grass will be long and unkempt, and a massive owl will fly overhead above them. Alice will feel as if she is being watched.

Traveling back to Polithea reveals a ruin, with buildings completely crumbled, and even the paths being almost indistinguishable. Among the remains of what once stood, blood is smeared across the walls
- "THEY ABANDONED US"
- "WHERE ARE YOUR GODS NOW?"
- Symbols of various Deities, charred and burnt
- The Symbol of the New Dawn, freshly painted. "The Divine light still shines within us and their Vestiges."

In a complete turnaround, Polithea is now one of the most unsafe regions to live in due to people who wish to hunt for Sacrina. Since Polithea is the birthplace of the gods, it is also where most of their fallen Sacrina will appear, making the region a high risk high reward territory. 

## First Encounter
- The party will encounter a scavenger that is the Vestige of [[Atrax]]. He will attempt to rough up the party for their Sacrina, and warn them that Nullvinar (name of the wasteland) isn't safe for a bunch of clean cloth ladies. Seranis noticed them leaving the Cathedral, which apparently appeared there overnight. He also noticed the time Sacrina on Ravi's back.

**Saving Throws** Dex +4, Wis +3 **Skills** Arcana +3, Insight +3  
**Senses** Darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 11 
**Languages** Common, Elvish 

---

#### Abilities

**Aura of Attraction.** Any creature starting its turn within 10 feet of the Vestige must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled 5 feet towards the Vestige.

---

#### Actions

**Multiattack.** The Vestige makes two attacks with his Gravitic Touch.

**Gravitic Touch.** _Melee Spell Attack:_ +5 to hit, reach 25 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 8 (1d6 + 5) force damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pulled/pushed 10 ft. This distance is doubled if under the **Float** status.

**Float** The Vestige targets one creature or object within 60 ft. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution Saving Throw or begin floating upwards at 15 feet a turn. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the start of its turn. Objects automatically fail.

**Fall** The Vestige targets one creature or object within 60 ft. The target must make a DC 14 Constitution Saving Throw or lose half of its movement speed, as the target is extremely heavy. If the target is mid air, it will take twice as much fall damage upon hitting the ground. The target can repeat the Saving Throw at the start of its turn. Objects automatically fail.

---

#### Reactions
**Deflect.** When a creature the Vestige can see attacks him with a ranged weapon attack, he can use his reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll, using his magnetic powers to slightly alter the projectile's trajectory.

- Humanoid scavengers are not the only threat in Nullvinar, but beast vestiges as well. Depending on the outcome of the battle, a large bear, Vestige of the storm deity Tempestra, will emerge to eat the Sacrina dropped by Seranis after he is killed. Or, if the party is near death and unable to kill him, the bear will conveniently intervene. Realistically, the party will not dare to fight the bear. Alice may also use speak with animals on the bear, and it will warn the party that these lands are dangerous.

## Discovery
The party may take a moment to assess Polithea in its new state and can discover the following:
- The bluff she visits for therapy is almost entirely dried up, and the trees surrounding the peak have rotted and withered, leaving it exposed and open and subject to harsh winds that drown out any sounds.
- The Eternal Library is still somehow in tact, but is being guarded by a man named Bernarheim, who is a Vestige of Athanea. He will tell the party more about the dire situation in the wasteland.
- Asteri will notice that Mortem is missing. Re-summoning him, he will cause a scene, claiming she disappeared, and that its been forever.

## Bernarheim
![[Bernarheim.png]]
- Bernarheim is a Vedalken man who has absorbed the Athanea Sacrina, making him compelled to serve as a bookkeeper in the Eternal Library, despite the dangers of the wasteland. He unfortunately had a rough merge with Athanea, and thus, gained some pretty bad side effects from becoming a vestige.
	- His body is very frail, most of his life force now circulates throughout his brain.
	- He talks really fast and often needs to slow down his mind in order to be intelligible
	- He often has to squint really hard to refocus his mind before it is taken over by Athanea
	- He can only roam the halls of the library or else Athanea will make him lose his mind. He can only eat the animals that wander into the library, and there are traps all over for that reason.
- He will inform the party a bit about what has happened. He will tell them that it was 3 or 4 generations ago when things began to fall. The Divine War ended with a tense negotiation, but still after that, things began to worsen. First it was the day cycle, then droughts. Between the natural disasters, the arts died, and people fell into despair. A large uprising occurred, and since then everything has fallen to rubble.
- He will inform the party that Nullvinar is now one of the more dangerous territories in the world, and that they must flee North to a place called the New Dawn. Their missionaries offered for him to stay, but he could not leave. It will rest on the border of modern Druvina and Arkaelia. 
- As for the library, the forbidden section will be opened and primarily looted. Only a few items remain.
	- A slightly damaged lute (+2 instrument)
	- A book written in Abyssal
	- A bag of holding
	- A cloak of Elvenkind
- Bernarheim will also give them a compass attuned from a map to lead them to the New Dawn.

- https://www.dndspeak.com/2018/03/23/100-hallucinations/#google_vignette
- The mist is highly potent, and thus, up to three effects can be active at once. A new effect is applied every 5 minutes, and if they pass, they will also lose one effect placed on them.
Furthermore, the mist also contains Wild Magic properties, and pivots based off the good fortune of the party.

- Navigation with a perception check
  
### Blue Event - Wandering Carnival
The party may stumble across the Enchanted Caravan, a group of traveling performers who hope to bring back joy into the wasteland. Upon viewing the booths, the party will notice that there are many tributes to Ephara. Conveniently, they are on their way to the New Dawn to "show some refuges the light."

The Enchanted Caravan is a large rolling platform with steampunk wheels, and is pulled by 8 horses and the strong man, Brogan.

In the center, there will be a stage with the crest of Ephara. It is said that playing an instrument on the stage can bless a person with magical powers, if they should try it.

## Dream from Kairox
While dreaming, the party will wake up in a synchronized dream, where they stand in an expansive wispy blue realm, with the Sacrina of Kairox floating in the center. When peering into it, the reflection depicts them all in different ways.
- Evie is missing a horn, one of the bag pipes is cracked, and she is covered in mud.
- Alice is also missing a horn, and she will have animal scars all over her body. 
- Ravi has en eye patch.
- Asteri is missing an ear and her eyes are completely black.
Kairox will begin yelling, "IT ISN'T SAFE HERE. WAKE UP" to save the party from being ambushed. Upon waking up, the party will hear the sound of a pack of ravenous animals approaching. As time goes on, he will be able to communicate longer phrases with the party as they grow in power.

If they have another dream, then Alice will be missing. Kairox will briefly state that they aren't ready yet, and that they must get stronger, and to reach the New Dawn. When they awake, the Seed of Sylvanus will be crawling into Alice's body. Upon killing it, some of it will enter Alice's body, and the seed will reveal a smaller Sacrina of Sylvanus. 

## Arrival at the New Dawn
As the party approaches the New Dawn, within 5 hours of entry, they will begin to see signs with the New Dawn logo, and a paved path leading them there. The New Dawn enclave is located deep within the forest, and requires ascending a large mountain to reach the forest on top. Once the party peers above the steps up, they will notice an encampment with 5 pillars.
