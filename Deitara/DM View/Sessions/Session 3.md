Picking up from last session, the party will escape through a tree portal to the Havenwood Grove, a nearby druid settlement. 
## Havenwood Grove
Only 4 miles west of the New Dawn, the Havenwood Grove is a massive Druidic Settlement that hides itself from the New Dawn's gaze. Operating in the upper branches of the Elderwood forest, the inhabitants of this colony live hundreds of feet in the air. Furthermore, grand druids use spells to mask the presence of the Grove, and no tracking spells work within it.

The Elder Druid, Lorian Navori, is a Tiefling woman from Druvina and is over 1700 years old, dating back to before the apocalypse, and one of the last firsthand sources of the crimes of Umbra and the New Dawn. She rescues people from throughout the lands, particularly New Dawn deserters, and trains people for a day where they can take back the Sacrina. She believes the current Pantheon has more than enough power to actually fix the wasteland, but instead are focused on keeping their image and rising to godhood, abandoning mortals the same way the gods did before.
## Arrival
On the other side of a tree, the party will land in the scouting room of the Grove, where crystal balls with hawk views are scattered all throughout, with people manning them. Here, the Grove performs surveillance on the New Dawn, and saw that they needed help. Greeting them will be an Eladrin named Eli, and he will tell them about the New Dawn.
- "Glad you're safe. Let's get you bandaged up now."
- "Not quite the ray of sunshine you were expecting from a place called the New Dawn, huh"

The party will be properly healed from their fight, and then Eli will tell them of what happened. 

"Well if they attacked you, then I take it you four learned of the ugly truth. Of that fact that the New Dawn is a facade. In all honesty, I thought it was too good to be true too. But man, that comfortable life really makes you try to be complacent to that voice in your head that tells you something is wrong."

"Well, to be quite honest with you, I don't know the full story myself yet. I'm still a bit new around here, just came in two weeks ago. I've let the Elder Druid know you arrived, and I'll be sure to give you a proper look around on the way over there"

## First Look
While being toured around Havenwood, the party will notice just how high up from the ground they are. Rope bridges and ziplines span between massive Elderwood trees, with tree houses grafted on the sides of the bark. Below them, they hear lots of movement and training from the Grovewardens. The Grove is mostly split up by a bundle, which is a grouping of 3-4 trees.
## Lorian Navori
Atop the highest Elder tree, peering above the clouds, the Elder Druid Lorian spends her time fueling the forest. She is robed in a beautiful bundle of flowers, and her horns have turned into bark. She is a light red color, similar to Alice. With her in the peak is an Aaracokra woman named Morwen, who serves as her lieutenant.

"Welcome to Havenwood. I hear you've caused the New Dawn quite the commotion. I bet you've got many questions, and luckily for you, I've dedicated my life to having answers. I turn 1700 next month, which makes me older than the wasteland, if that changes your questions at all."

"Well, the New Dawn is only what they're called now. Long ago, the New Dawn went by the name Umbra, and was a radical group of people who were upset with how the gods were treating them.

With the Divine War coming to an end, you would have thought that the slow agony would stop, but it didn't. The gods where burnt out. Perhaps even disappointed in man. But for whatever reason, they just stopped listening to us. A very inspirational man named Vashar, a dragon-born man, well he knew how to rile people up. As the founder of Umbra, he started a campaign among a select few to spread dissatisfaction around the world. He met with nobility from each of the five regions, cutting a deal. If they used their influence to spread despair and distrust, they would have a seat and the new most valuable city in the world. It was his idea, that making people hate their gods would weaken them, and thus, turned everyone against the Divine. His theory was right.

Suddenly, things really started to go wild. For a full month, the day cycle stopped, and when it came back we had three moons. There was an immeasurable famine, followed by 17 days of typhoons and hurricanes. Then was the destruction of mankind. Everyone went to bed one day, and the next, buildings crumbled on top of them. Madness ensued, everywhere except there.

Now some call me crazy, but I don't think the idea of Vashar and his cultist friends killing the gods themselves is very far fetched. In fact, that is what I think they did. There are rumors of Vashar discovering a grand source of power before he formed the cult. Early narratives from the New Dawn mention him being chosen by the god of gods. Well at least that's what I heard when I lived there nearly 1500 years ago, about 200 years into the apocalypse.

That was until I got too nosy for my own good. I discovered Vashar and his little crypt the same way I'm told you all have. I had suspicions that things were too good to be true. And a dear friend of mine went no contact shortly after that whole ascendant thing, so I got nosy. That was when they left me with this. *Lorain will pull back her cloak to reveal her upper back, which has the same tattoo as Alice*"

## Lilith Navori
Born from Lorian Navori and Taric Barum, Lilith Navori was born in Polithea. Lorian met Taric during a religious retreat there, where she was studying the practice of Sylvanus to help rid the world of global hunger.

Lorian and Taric fell in love, and had Lilith, a young Tiefling girl who took after her mother. They lived in Polithea for four more years, before Lorian had felt the time was right to return to Druvina during the peak of the Divine War. However, tensions in Druvina were high, and thus, all other forms of hate rose too. 

Taric was regularly scrutinized by citizens of Druvina for being a Half-Elf and being married to a Tiefling. He was a strong man and shrugged it off, but even then, they were forced to move into the woods.

One fateful day, nearby nobles of the Taranis family heard of this, and decided to get rid of the foul odor from the forest. The four sons of the family killed Taric, and burnt Lorian alive. After noticing the small girl, they had a sliver of humanity, and decided not to kill her. Instead, they thought she could be "fixed," and put her in the Druvina care home system in hopes that she would learn a more "sophisticated culture." However, Lorian, due to her Tiefling ancestry, was not burnt alive.

Lorian spent the next 30 years healing herself in a slow grueling process, studying the arts of Sylvanus and Druidry. After regaining full function, she searched for nearly a hundred years for Lilith, but soon lost hope. In her moment of despair, that is when she learned of the New Dawn. 

## Assessment
Lorian is a vestige of Sylvanus, and the Havenwood have spent all of their time becoming compatible vessels for the true reincarnation of Sylvanus. She has spent the last 700 years retrieving every Sylvan Seed on the planet, which conveniently mark a Sylvanus Sacrina, but she is missing a small amount left, stored in Miriel. 

She will ask the party of any Sacrina they have seen / possess, and if she learns of Kairox, she will tell the party the following.
- "Kairox... where have I heard that name before...? It was rumored long ago that Vashar annihilated the gods himself. Now I could not find that possible, not without help at least. Their brainwashing was sloppy at first, but In early New Dawn narratives, a being named Kairox is said to have blessed the New Dawn with the power of time.  That was quickly taken away from their history books, but perhaps there is some reason for it."
- If that is the case, then perhaps you all are like some prophetic chance we have been hoping for. We have witnessed in very rare occurrences time skips occurring around the temple. I'm sure they keep that to a minimum, but waiting for 1500ish years has its perks. Do you think that skipping is him using his power, the power that Kairox granted him? And if that is the case, do you think you could counter it?

## Words from Kairox
Kairox will confirm everything Lorian claims about his Sacrina. He will reveal that out of 97,501,415,872,135 alternate timelines, providing Vashar and the party with the Sacrina in a 60/40 proportion was the only way to stop the apocalypse. Now that the timeline has been set, he can no longer view the proper steps along the way, and his position on the true pantheon has shifted.

## Training
Lorian will propose the party takes time to train and get stronger, and hopefully consume a larger portion of the Kairox Sacrina, which he will follow up with. The party will spend 1 month training in Havenwood, and will then go back to Polithea to truly test their might in combat against the raiders there, perhaps even bringing back Sacrina (or Bernarheim). Also, the party will learn about extracting a Sacrina from a body.
