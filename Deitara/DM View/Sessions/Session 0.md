## Entrance
Welcome grand adventurers, to the captivating planet of Deitara. A beautifully expansive world, full of enchantingly diverse terrain - from the expansive blue oceans of Meridia, to the lush forest groves of Druvina. But most importantly, Deitara is a world dictated by the divine and its presence. A power so gently powerful, yet so opportune for the taking. And that is exactly what is happening in the current day and age. The Divine War, a battle between the Five Great Nations continues to rage on, with these very gods fighting on the front line. 

And of course, this world is home to many nations, all with their diverse cultures, demographics, and Deities, but for the sake of our story, we will begin in the safe haven and birthplace of both mortal and divine - Polithea, also known to contemporary historians as the Unscathed Lands. But don't let that name fool you. As current residents of Polithea, you know all too well that although the turmoil of the Divine War does not happen on Polithean lands, the irreparable damage to the gods partaking in the war has caused unrest to its people.

Our story of triumph and redemption begins on the start of the first week of Havara, marking the middle of the year. It is the start of the week, Sunday the first, 1728. In the past 7 days, you have all heard plenty that the Sentinels have their hands full with the aftershock of the war, and whether that be for nobility, kindness, or some extra pocket change, you all have decided to help. Meet Hanlen at Mount Beerympus, where he expects you by 1:00PM.
## Introductions
The party will roll a d20 to determine the order they are introduced, where they will get time to detail what they are up to before going to meet Hanlen.
### Evie Decabraso
- Evie will be street performing right outside of the bar for tips, and will walk in as the party arrives.
### Ravi Moss
- Ravi will awake from a dream at around 8 in the morning. The dream will detail a beautiful woman made from the stars that glistens at night, with pale white skin, pointed ears, and purple eyes. However, as she notices them, she will turn around, transforming to become rotted and undead. This will be a funny depiction of Asteri for no apparent reason. Ravi will then be prompted to go to the library.
### Alice Jane
- Alice will be fashionably late, climbing into the chair as a cat and poofing into a person. 
### Asteri Lysithea
- Asteri will be heard trying to bargain with a Sentinel in the Eternal Library to get restricted access to upper floors.

## Hanlen
- Sitting in the back, clad in the typical Gold, Blue, and Silver armored uniform of the Sentinel, Hanlen is a large brutish Orc. He carries a great sword on his back, and is roughly 8 feet tall, and has 3 half drunk beers, despite it being 1:00 PM. He has an eye patch, and his tusks are quite large. However, despite his strong appearance, he seems rather intimidating, and may have a beer belly under the armor.

- "Thank you for coming, ya know we Sentinel really can use all the help we can get. Although I will say I was expecting... well... a little more... But nonetheless! You lot will do. I've got a list here with four small tasks for you all to do, should be pretty straight forward. Normally I would send that little shit Bob to get these smaller jobs done, but I already aired out my complaints on the job posting... Heh. Keeping the small jobs for Bob cuz he's a little gnome man yay big with a dumb curled mustache. Anyways, now I'm done. This paper should have the locations and instructions for all the reported disturbances we've got over the past few days that have gone unchecked."
- As the party leaves, Hanlen will issue a last minute warning:
- "OH!!!! Also, actually I will say this before I continue. I want no questions of this. I mean it. Any question asked with deduct 50 gold from the contract. For all four of you. *looks around*. There is only one thing you need to know of. If you encounter a weird glowing crystal about this big, and perhaps hums a little, maybe even talks. Do NOT, and I mean, do NOT pick it up with your bare hands. Pick it up with a cloth or bag, and bring it back to me. And then maybe I'll up the reward a bit since you were good. Kapiche?"

## Hanlen's Quest
### Quest 1 Roleplay:
- The party will need find a magical scroll known as the Arbopher, which is now resting at a shop.
- Gorvik, the shopkeeper of Gorviks Godly Goblin Goods, is a 3.5 foot tall Goblin who is obsessed with gold and a profit.
![[Gorvik.png]]
- After successfully finding the Arbopher in the mess, Gorvik will ask a steep 250 gold for the artifact, which the party will have to reduce.

### Quest 2 Adventure:
- The party will be dispatched to a neighborhood about 30 minutes away. Unexpectedly, a massive tree has grown from the middle of the neighborhood, and many family homes are being overtaken by the relentless roots. Standing, peering at it with sadness, a Human woman will be looking with sorrow. Her name is Joanne, and she called for the Sentinels. "I don't see the Sentinel crest. Thank you for taking your personal time to help us... This tree has been growing like a plague the last few days, stopping at nothing. We've sent a member of our community in a passage within the tree two days ago, and he's since gone missing."
![[Pasted image 20240620184627.png]]
- The party will have to enter the basin of the tree through a cave
- Within the tree, there will be 5 different perilous. obstacles that will require skill checks to navigate within the basin of the tree.
	- Fall into a pit, with 5 different berries. They must choose which one to eat for a door to open. The correct berry will taste like the best food they've ever had, and a door will open. DC 12 Survival or Nature check to identify the right one. If wrong, roll a d4. These will last 1 minute.
		- You turn into a potted plant
		- You begin glowing brightly
		- You grow two more arms
		- You can only speak backwards
	- A tree person will be blocking passage. Attacking it will show it regenerating, and it is non hostile. The only phrase it will say, is "why do you come here." The party must persuade it to pass.
	-  Roots that grasp onto your legs as you cross the hallway. DC 12 Athletics or Acrobatics check to pass, or any other ideas. If failed, they will be restrained. Failing 3 times in a row will get them stuck permanently. Succeeded will remove 2. Having 1 will raise the DC to 15 and make it only Athletics.
	- Tree eyes in another passage. Once they see you, they will shriek and extend roots, blocking passage, which will disappear as soon as they are unseen. In this hallway, there is various difficult terrain and shrubbery. DC 15 Stealth check, or an average of 15.
	- A massive chasm about 45 feet across to a platform that shows an artifact on a pedestal. To reach the other side, the party must jump from branch to branch, with roughly 10 branches spanning the chasm. The party cannot see the bottom, only a bit of mist. DC 16 Acrobatics to pass, or some other creative idea. When vaulting, they will also hear "Please..... help.... me...." This is from Joanne's husband, John.
- The party may retrieve the Seed of Sylvanus from the tree, which will abruptly cause it to disintegrate. As it does, all of the damage it has done to the neighborhood is undone, and the party will be standing in the middle of the town square.
- As the tree slowly crumbles, Alice will notice very briefly the tattoo on her neck engraved on a larger root. However, she could have been seeing things.
### Quest 3 Combat:
- As the party stands in the town Plaza, the people of the neighborhood will begin applauding them. However, as they stand there victoriously, it will quickly go wrong. A fireball will be tossed from above the horizon, straight towards the party. The Seed was intentionally planted there by two cultists, who believe they must create a new Sylvanus tree and make Polithea his rightful home instead of Druvina. To do so, they believe it requires sacrifice, and was hoping the tree would consume the plaza and its people whole. 
- "YOU RUINED IT. THESE PEOPLE, NO ONE OUTSIDE THIS LITTLE SECLUDED TOWN COULD GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THEM. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF BEING SOIL TO THE GREAT LORD SYLVANUS. WE'RE TAKING BACK THAT SEED, AND AFTER WE SLAUGHTER YOU FOUR, YOU WILL BE ITS FERTILIZER."
- The civilians will flee, however, Joanne will help with a crossbow if needed.

### Quest 4 Bob:
- The party will stumble across a cathedral about a 45 minute walk from the innards of Polithea, about 15 minutes into the outer forest. It will be a large old clock tower, and it will be raining as they arrive. When they approach, they will notice some raindrops stop, and continue to float in mid air, as if they froze. Also, they will teleport forward randomly at certain points in time. Words will also skip as well.
- Inside of this cathedral, they will walk down a long, dim, aisle of prayer rows before seeing a short, 4 foot tall figure wielding a Sacrina. Bob, who claims he heard whispers coming from the stone about the future of the war.
- Bob will be frantic, and swearing that the world is going to end, and that the Divine War will result in the death of hundreds. He thinks whatever this stone is can help him stop the war, or at least make the outcome better. He wants to be a hero, so maybe his wife will take him back and he can see his kids again.
- At any sudden move towards him, Bob will impale himself with the Sacrina, causing the immature merging into a Vestige of Kairox.
![[Bob.png]]
- "I swear I'm not crazy, this thing really did talk to me! I mean, just look at it. Can't you feel it? The power just surging out of this thing is unbelievable. Just imagine it. Big old me walking down the battle field of the Divine War and saving everyone! Maybe then my wife will take me back, AND BETTER YET, MAYBE I CAN SEE MY KIDS! And if the Divine War carries on... my kids... they'll die surely... I'm fed up"
- Merging with the Sacrina, Bob will begin to both increase and decrease in age at certain appendages, tearing his little body to shreds. He will begin floating, screaming in many overlapping voices, and the cathedral will begin to crack. His body will begin to split and crack, with the ethereal light expanding out. On the wall, the light projects a prophecy.
	- A barren wasteland
	- A large encampment with 5 large pillars
	- A circle of hooded figures
	- Two symbols sliding and colliding with each other
	- Four figures surrounding a man
	- A large bear
![[Symbol 1.png]]
![[Symbol 2.png]]
- Bob will then absorb the light, and burst into dust which lightly dissipates through the cathedral. The Sacrina will then fall from the sky, and fall onto the floor, conveniently cracking into 4, roughly equal pieces, which the party will hopefully collect.

## The Apocalypse
The party will emerge from the Cathedral to a sky with 2 and a half moons, rotating in opposite directions from one another. Some of the trees will be growing upside down, with the roots beckoning to the sky. As they step out of the Cathedral, it will dramatically crumble. The grass will be long and unkempt, and a massive owl will fly overhead above them. Cara will feel as if she is being watched.

Traveling back to Polithea reveals a ruin, with buildings completely crumbled, and even the paths being almost indistinguishable. Among the remains of what once stood, blood is smeared across the walls
- "THEY ABANDONED US"
- "WHERE ARE YOUR GODS NOW?"
- Symbols of various Deities, charred and burnt
- The Symbol of the New Dawn, freshly painted. "The Divine light still shines within us and their Vestiges."
### Changes to the Players ties
**Evie**
- The bluff she visits for therapy is almost entirely dried up, and the trees surrounding the peak have rotted and withered, leaving it exposed and open and subject to harsh winds that drown out any sounds.

## First Encounter
- The party will encounter a scavenger that is the Vestige of (TODO: GRAVITY GOD), seeking to rough up the party, noticing their fine clothes and backpacks. He will also hopefully see a Sacrina, which he will want to take. If he wins, he will be attacked by a overgrown bear, who also ate the Sacrina of Tempestra. This is what was actually watching the party.
- The Bear will leave the party alone unless threatened.
