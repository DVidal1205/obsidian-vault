## Welcome to the New Dawn
- Upon arriving at the New Dawn, the party will be greeted with two priests of the light, and will be asked their names. They will be given clean clothes, in either a shirt or blouse option, as well as shorts, pants, or a skirt. On the clothes are crests symbolizing the Pantheon.
- The party, along with the 4 other refugees from the Ephara's Traveling Enchanters, will go on an tour of the New Dawn encampment to show them their new home.

Throughout the tour
### Tour Locations
- **Central Plaza:** The heart of the encampment where community gatherings, celebrations, and public announcements are made. In the center, there are five statues of the current Pantheon. Maris will go on to explain the importance of the Pantheon, how they are a symbol of hope, and that their worship makes them stronger.
- **Pantheon's Temple:** A grand temple devoted to the current Pantheon and their deities. Worshiping them makes them stronger, which makes the New Dawn stronger too. However, the catacombs beneath the temple are restricted from normal access. 
- **Command Center:** The command center is responsible for making sure New Dawn operations run smoothly. Here, the party will be assigned their living quarters, and will have up to 3 days to decide on an occupation.
- **The Mess Hall:** Offering some of the best meals in the wasteland, the Mess Hall makes sure that people are full and happy. The party will be offered high quality food.
- **Communal Farms:** A vast region of lands with various crops and livestock. The party may spot Miriel using magic on the farm.
- **The Workshops:** A massive warehouse zone dedicated to crafting and repairing items, as well as textile works.
- **The Healing Quarters:** Equipped with medicinal herbs and supplies, volunteers specializing in creating and administering medicine work here.
- **The Education Center:** A free institution where citizens can learn various trades, arts, arcana, or history.
- **Trove of Resistance:** One of the jewels of the New Dawn, a library that contains healthy documents and archives from before the apocalypse. However, many of these documents may be altered. Home to some of the best scholars, linguists, and historians on Deitara.
- **Housing Centers:** Housing takes up a lot of space, so instead of homes, there are various pods of small dome-like huts constructed of wood.
- **The Bottomless Falls:** A massive waterfall around back the encampment, powering many water generators. Falling for roughly 1000 feet, the mist makes it impossible to see the bottom.
## The Pantheon
The five guardians of the New Dawn are called the Pantheon, and each are vestige of the two true gods of each of the Five Great Nations, attempting to establish hope seeing them work together. However, these five are descendants of the first extremists of Umbra. Generation by generation, these five bloodlines were groomed into having only one goal - ascending to real godhood.

While they undoubtedly do wonderful things for the camp, they are still ruthless individuals at their core. They have genuine care for the New Dawn, but mainly because the admiration from its people serves as an excellent power source.
### Asilnor Lysithea
**Male Astral Elf**
**Vestige of Amatera and Dentra**
- Asilnor serves as the guardian of day and night, and ensures a seemingly normal day and night cycle. He holds a field around the encampment that limits daylight and moonlight exposure from the apocalyptic mega sun, and is able to coordinate with Miriel to plan for a bountiful harvest.
### Brundar Ironfist
**Male Dwarf**
**Vestige of Hephaeston and Voltaris**
- Brundar is the chief engineer of the New Dawn's infrastructure, and responsible for the fortuitous walls alongside the encampment. He built the rudimentary electric grid from scratch, even inventing his own river powered mill.
### Miriel Greenward
**Female Kalashtar**
**Vestige of Sylvanus and Gaia**
- Miriel is directly responsible for the encampment's food supplies and herbs, creating plentiful harvests and raising healthy livestock. She can accelerate plant growth, heal the land, purify water, and even construct huts and buildings using the roots from the ground.
### Jorun Stormbrew
**Male Human**
**Vestige of Tempestra and Thalassos**
- Jorun serves as the chief of defense against external threats and natural disasters. Not only can he redirect massive storms that would harm the encampment, he can create them to ward off incoming attackers.
### Vaelora Darkwhisper
**Female Tiefling**
**Vestige of Mystara and Athenaea**
- Vaelora is an expert strategist and arcane protector for the New Dawn. She is responsible for managing the encampments rich trove of historical documents, the only collection that survived the apocalypse. She also is the primary planner for construction, and works with Brundar to keep the city well planned.

## Kairox's Brief Introduction
During their next rest, the party will have another shared, collective dream, once again with the time Sacrina floating in the center. This time, the voice in their head will be slightly more audible.
- "My name is Kairox. Rest up now, but you need to get stronger. I can't tell you yet, not without damaging your spirit."
## Vashar Korath, leader of Umbra
Deep within the Catacombs of the Pantheon Temple lives Vashar Korath, an Aasimar man biding his time until he can gain ascension. However, he has been unable to find the remaining time Sacrina to do so. However, he is over 1500 years old and is suffering from old age. Thus, the New Dawn frequently sends people to Vashar for him to harvest their life force, a power he has gained from the Time Sacrina.

## The Ascendants 
A program coupled deeply in the New Dawn culture, the Ascendants are a group of people who travel the world to spread the word about the New Dawn and help others find the light. However, traveling the wasteland is a dangerous mission, and the odds of returning are low, making it the perfect front for missing people.

Ascendants are chosen based on their devotion to the Pantheon, as those more devoted are less likely to question. A large ceremony is held in the Central Plaza, celebrating the "Chosen" before they embark on their righteous journey. They are then taken into the catacombs and drained of their life force, and a simple illusion of the chosen person is seen leaving the encampment.

The party will witness their first Ascension at their time of arrival, where Maris will be very excited for the chosen man.

## Time at the New Dawn
### Evie
- Going through her romantic redemption, Evie will be hit on by someone for her wonderful music, and hopefully foster a romantic relationship with her.
- She will be named Rayleth, and is another Satyr like Evie.
### Alice
- Alice is going to notice one peculiar fact about the New Dawn - there are no trees in sight, except for way out in the forest. She notices some chopped stubs, but this makes her feel extremely out of place given she lived in a forest.
### Asteri
- Asteri may have the chance to visit a scholar or linguist within the Trove of Resistance to decipher her Mortem Tome.
- If she does attempt to learn more about the Tome, she will learn that it is in Abyssal. She will be given a Dictionary and Guide to Abyssal, and can attempt to decipher or learn the language in about a week.
### Ravi
- Ravi will likely work in the medicinal sector of the New Dawn, where they will meet all sorts of strange people. However, they will learn that there are a lot of kids in the New Dawn, a lot of which are missing limbs, parents, or a normal life.

The party will likely remain in the New Dawn for another 2 weeks until the next Ascension, where hopefully they get nosy. 

## Discovery
The party will discover Vashar in the catacombs, as well as the Umbra crest on the floor. Surrounding Vashar will be 16 hooded cultists, all of which are there to keep Vashar healthy.

Vashar will snap, freezing time, however the party will be immune. He will then walk up to the Chosen, and kill them, draining their life force. However, he will notice the party, and instruct Asilnor and Jorun to put the city on lock down. The encampment will have alarms sound, and it will be announced that there have been four who stray from the light.

They will be confronted by Asilnor, who will beat the party within an inch of their life. He will injure the party as per the visions they saw at the start of the campaign.
- Ripping off Evie's horn, and using it to puncture Ravi's eye.
- Asteri undergoing a Mortem transformation.
- Alice subconsciously protecting herself with bark, turning some of her skin into it permanently. 

After the party has taken a significant beating a smaller tree will have sprouted up in the time the fighting has occurred. It will open, and a voice will shout from within: "HURRY AND GET IN IF YOU WANT TO LEAVE THIS PLACE ALIVE."

The group on the other side of the tree will be a group of elder druids who have been aware of Umbra and the New Dawn since its conception, and with the help of the party, will try to disrupt the New Dawn next session.
