## Backstory
Born and raised in Morellus, a progressive Magic/Tech Nation on Miravalis, Caspian exhibited an aptitude for magic and trickery at a young age. He was recognized as a hybrid of human and aquatic creature due to his distinct scales and aquatic features. Using the plentiful natural magic of Miravalis, he became a cleric, choosing the Trickery Domain as his specialty. His life took an interesting turn when he accidentally opened a rift to another plane during a magical surge. Since then, he has been fascinated by other realms, yearning to explore and understand them, adding another layer to his already curious nature.
## Quirks
Caspian has a peculiar habit of absent-mindedly twirling his hair when deep in thought. His moods are as fluctuating as the tides, often shifting from calm tranquility to stormy passion. He often speaks in riddles and jargon, preferring to encase his true intentions in layers of duplicity.
## Fashion
Caspian prefers clothing that mirrors his aquatic heritage, often wearing flowing robes of deep blues and greens adorned with intricate shell and pearl embellishments. His attire is typically adorned with magical symbols and glyphs of protection and trickery.
## Goals
Caspian's ultimate goal is to harness the unpredictable and volatile natural magic of Miravalis to stabilize and manipulate the rifts to other planes for safe exploration and knowledge gathering. He wishes to use his skills in trickery to navigate the political landscapes of Miravalis' nations, hoping to unite them in the understanding of these plane rifts. Above all, Caspian seeks the thrill of the unknown, driven by his insatiable curiosity and adventurous spirit.
