### Implementation Confidence
I get the feeling we're a little "back-end" brained here.

- JS - 4.33
- HTML - 2.66
- CSS - 2.33
- React - 2.33
- Tailwind - 2.33

### Outline
1. Building a site
2. Tools to make the site solve a problem, and intermediate steps
3. Deployment

### The Basics of building a site
A noob website consists of main 3 elements in implementation - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. At the end of the day, most of the tools are simply supersets and extensions of these three that make development easier and more impactful.
- JSX = HTML++
- Tailwind = CSS++
- React = JavaScript++
- (Disclaimer: Giga-simplification)

---

### HTML
- HTML: Hypertext Markup Language
- A series of nested elements to represent a website structure
- Different attributes that serve for differing behavior
- Redundant in some cases...

### JSX
- The prodigal lovechild born from HTML and JavaScript
- Functional HTML flows and limiting redundancy
- Literally Js in HTML...

### Whats with the long ass class names?

- Compiled, and intellisense supported
- Adds element-level style system, which is incredibly powerful
- Universal measurement system - enforces consistency
- Allows for utility overrides
