About Me
----------------------------
My name is Dylan Vidal, and I am a current Computer Science student at the University of Central Florida and an aspiring software engineer. Since discovering Computer Science and Software Development at my community college through dual-enrollment, I have been more than passionate about the process of development. I find fulfillment and joy in putting together a project from start to finish, and being able to identify and solve complex challenges with master problem solving techniques and algorithms. Growing up, I had little direction with what I wanted to do in terms of my profession, and all of that changed drastically after I took my first two programming courses in C++ and Python. Despite being confined to a Command Line Interface, I was thrilled with the prospect of writing functional, responsive software, and would love to work on even bigger and better projects at large corporations like this one.

Why Google?
----------------------------
One thing I have heard about Google in the Software Development niche is that the culture of the company is truly unique and amazing. I have since reached out to Google employees and followed them on LinkedIn, and digesting some of the posts about various events or traditions at Google is really exciting! Google works on big things, and I would love to be a part of large scale projects where I feel the work I do makes a difference to hundreds of thousands of people. If I had to think of a perfect company to work for, Google undoubtedly comes to mind.

Why Me?
----------------------------
I believe I would be a good candidate for the Google STEP program because I have an innate curiosity and drive to learn. While I am immensely fortunate and grateful for my opportunity to embark on a university education, most of my technical skills I have acquired thus far have been self taught. In the face of dissatisfaction or uncertainty, I take it upon myself to learn on my own. LinkedIn Learning was an impactful resource for me as a developer, where I self taught HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to construct my own portfolio website after feeling behind the curve. More recently, I was dissatisfied with my projects feeling underwhelming in the Command Line Interface, and so I taught myself the Tkinter Python GUI Library and advanced to the Qt Creator app for C++ and Python. With no direction or module, I dove into the documentation and learned through trial and error, and I expect this style to remain throughout my time as a developer, which is great as I found this method of development fun and engaging. I will never proclaim myself to be the most intelligent developer, but I would say I am among a high caliber in terms of curiosity, which in my opinion, is a trait all good developers have.
