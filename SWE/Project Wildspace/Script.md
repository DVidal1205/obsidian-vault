Hello Everyone, I'm Dylan, the Solo Dev at Project Wildspace Web, and I am here to give you all a quick demo of our web application. Project Wildspace is a Worldbuilding Assistant built on top of Artificial Intelligence to make worldbuilding for your fantasy worlds quick and easy. So, let's get started.

First things first, we need to make an account. To get started, click the button below, but I already have an account, so I'll go ahead and login. If you do not have an account already, our auth provider Kinde will set you up an account and direct you to the dashboard.

In the dashboard, we will have cards for each of our worlds. These worlds are the basis of our generations, and thus, should be as detailed as possible. I'll go ahead and paste in the information for my current long-running TTRPG campaign, Miravalis.

Rexia: Colonial Powerhouse.
Morellus: Progressive Magic/Tech Nation.
Haunted Wilds: Secluded Forest of Monsters and Hunters.
Claystone Mages: A Settlement of Gifted Nature Mages.
Arboran Commonwealth: A Forest with Magical Sentient Trees.
Old Stones: Mystical Ancient Region.
Sarai Desert: Theocracy of Setre.
Dragonhide Summits: Man and Dragons Living in Harmony.
Starless Swamps: Uninhabited Aberration Territory.
