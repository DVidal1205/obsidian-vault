Hello Everyone, I'm Dylan, the Developer behind Project Wildspace Web, and I am here to give you all a quick demo of our web application. Project Wildspace is a Worldbuilding Assistant built on top of Artificial Intelligence to make worldbuilding for your fantasy worlds quick and easy. So, let's get started.

First things first, we need to make an account. To get started, click the button below, but I already have an account, so I'll go ahead and login. If you do not have an account already, our auth provider Kinde will set you up an account and direct you to the dashboard.

In the dashboard, we will have cards for each of our worlds. These worlds are the basis of our generations, and thus, should be as detailed as possible. I'll go ahead and paste in the information for my current long-running TTRPG campaign, Miravalis. In my world description, I went ahead and listed a brief description of each of the countries and regions in my world to help make my generations as best as possible.

1989
Extremely High, with most commonfolk having some sort of magic
Earth equivalent of the Industrial Revolution

Miravalis is the planet of this world, and is immensely rich in natural magic. The wild natural magic of this world manifests itself in a variety of ways, such as natural disaster-like surges of magical energy, or the collapsing of oversatured magical volume, creating tears and rifts throughout the surface of Miravalis into other planes far beyond its own. Many people have come to call Miravalis home and nations have emerged under the breadth of opportunity this planet offers. To date, a total of 9 territories/nations call Miravalis its home:

Rexia: Colonial Powerhouse.
Morellus: Progressive Magic/Tech Nation.
Haunted Wilds: Secluded Forest of Monsters and Hunters.
Claystone Mages: A Settlement of Gifted Nature Mages.
Arboran Commonwealth: A Forest with Magical Sentient Trees.
Old Stones: Mystical Ancient Region.
Sarai Desert: Theocracy of Setre.
Dragonhide Summits: Man and Dragons Living in Harmony.
Starless Swamps: Uninhabited Aberration Territory.

Now that we've created our world, we can step into it by clicking on the generated tile. This page is where you'll be spending most of your time. Here, we have a variety of entities to generate. For the sake of demonstration, let's go ahead and make a character. Using the prompt, I can ask for a character that fits whatever circumstance I need them for. In this instance, I want to come up with a really well known baker, so I'll go ahead and ask for that. After waiting a few seconds, we have our character made for us. But we all know that halflings are truly the best bakers. How can we override this? Well, we can also type into these fields, and by checking it, we can ask the generation to keep it. So let's go ahead and try again. You can mix and match these toggles and fields to make your perfect character. When you're done, you can go ahead and generate an image for the entity as well.

That was fun, but the true power of Project Wildspace is when you utilize the contextualization feature. What if I want the bakery that CHARACTER works at? What if I wanted them to have founded it? Well, we can navigate to the building tab and inspect the contextualize button. Here, we will find a list of all other generations we have mode. By picking the contextualization, we allow this entity to be referenced in our generation. By mixing and combining the toggling feature and the contextualization, you have rich control over what is created. Once you have all of the entities you like, you can go ahead and view them by navigating to the sidebar and clicking on the name of the entity. Here, you can update existing fields by overwriting them and saving. You can also save the entities as plain text markdown, which you can view in your favorite markdown document viewers like obsidian. 

If you like what you've seen here, feel free to navigate to projectwildspace.tech to try it for yourself, or, upgrade to one of our paid plans to get the best experience. Thank you for watching, and feel free to share any interesting generations you've made in the comment section below.
