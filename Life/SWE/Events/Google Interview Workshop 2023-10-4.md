## Part 3 - Preparing for Interviews
**1 Week to Complete Both**
Survey
- 15 minutes
- Work-style and Location preferences
Coding Assessment
- 90 Minutes
- Unlimited practice before the deadline
- No outside resources
	- Can reference official documentation and standard libraries
- 2 Coding Questions
**Virtual Interviews**
- Test equipment before interviews
- Do not mute your microphone - integrity and collaboration
- Have a pen/paper ready to scribble notes
- Share your thoughts **OUT LOUD**
- Don't search for outside references
- Be yourself!
**Technical Interview**
- 5 minute of introductions
- 35 minutes of technical assessment
- 5 minutes of closing questions
**Language Suggestions**
- C/C++
- Java
- Python
- JavaScript
- Go*
**Topics you Should for STEP**
Algorithms
- for loops, while loops, nested loops
- string manipulation
- conditional logic (if/else)
Data Structures
- arrays
**Interviewer Considerations**
- How did the candidate analyze the problem?
- Did the candidate miss any special or edge cases?
	- ASK FOR THE PARAMETERS OF INPUT. DO NOT ASSUME.
- Did the candidate approach the problem methodically and logically?
- Does the candidate show strong CS fundamentals
- Did the candidate produce working code? Did they test it?
	- Tests are traced. You are not able to run the code until you submit
- Is the candidates code clean and easy to read and maintain?
- Can the candidate explain their ideas clearly?
**Steps for success during the interview**
1. Clarify the questions. Ask for clarification
	1. What are example inputs and outputs?
	2. Can numbers be negative? Can they be repeated?
	3. Are the values sorted? If not, is there a sort function?
	4. Do you have to clean the data, or can you assume the input is always valid?
2. Design a solution
	1. Do not start coding immediately
	2. Start talking about a solution. Describe potential approaches, algorithms, or performances (Bonus for Big O runtime)
	3. Handle edge Cases
	4. THINK OUT LOUD
3. Write your code
	1. Break your solution into smaller parts using helper functions
	2. If you don't know the API, ask
		1. What is the length function?
	3. Write the code in the language you are most comfortable with
	4. Write full code (not pseudocode)
4. Test your code
	1. Don't assume your code works
	2. Run through test cases to check your work
	3. If you have extra time, analyze runtime. (Bonus for optimizing with spare time, or at least talking about how you would)
**Common Mistakes**
- Jumping into code
- Not talking about examples and neglecting testing
- Not writing real code
**Step Sample Problem**
Given a string of parenthesis, check if its balanced
- All open parenthesis have closed parenthesis
- No closes coming before closes ")(" is not balanced, even though equal
