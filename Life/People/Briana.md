### Appreciation Email

Good afternoon Briana,

I am writing this email to express our gratitude at 22-205 for all of the amazing help you've given us during our move-in process. I know it is your job to do so, but the service we've received goes beyond just duty. You have shown us a considerable amount of support and compassion during a time where we are already off-balance transitioning from home to an entirely new location and lifestyle, and to that we extend our thanks. We appreciate you following up on the issues, and look forward to informing you on all of the issues being resolved.  ThanksÂ again for helping us make our new place our new home.

Thanks again,
Apartment 22-205
