# Session
- Wrap up the aftermath of A40, figure out which direction everyone left towards, and calculate gold for the day.
- 5 days of downtime before the first letter on A45, which talks of the first trial, the Trial of Perseverance, beginning on A50
- One day of downtime may be spent at the Trial Parade, a standard practice for each of the 12 Trials. Here, massive nationalistic festivities will be held as well as carnival-esque showcases. Due to the nature of the last ceremony, all 5 Crownsguard will be present.
### Trial Invitation Newsletter
"To all who receive this letter, prepare to be reborn anew, along with our great nation of Morellus. The Royal Crucible beckons, and our beautiful homeland hopes you answer back with roaring devotion. 

This is the formal announcement of the first of twelve trials contained in the crucible, the Trial of Perseverance. According to our wonderful mathematicians at the Grand Morellan University, a total of 1,610,194 proud citizens have expressed their interest in standing up for what is just.

The Trial of Perseverance is set to begin at sunrise on Aequefel, Aurburnvelle 50 1989, and end five days later, on the following Aequefel, Aurburnvelle 55. The day prior, a grand festival will be held at the Grand Morellan University to kick off the wondrous formative activities ahead of us. The pre-trial festival begins at noon on Terrador, Aurburnvelle 49.

On the topic of festivities, the Crown is well aware of the tragedy that occurred during the commencement ceremony. We send our condolences to the families of the 34 lives lost, and we commend the many Morellans who fought to protect their peers with no incentive other than a good heart and tight knit community. We are committed to ensuring the vessels of terror will be brought to justice, and no such tragedies will be incurred by the events of the Crucible. Because of this, to those who wish to wreak havoc at the upcoming festival, all 5 of the Morellan Crownsguard will be present, as well as half of the entirety of the Ivory Warden Fleet.

Attached below is a handheld card detailing the rules and objectives of the first trial. Read it carefully, as doing so ensures your success in becoming an agent of justice, serving the Beacon of Hope."
### Trial of Perseverance Instructions
1. This is a five day trial that will test competitors abilities to work together, make calculated decisions, comprehensive combat skills, and survival capabilities.
2. This is a team event, and your assigned team of 4 has been attached to this card. Competitors must return in a team of 4, with each of the members dawning the same team card.
3. Competitors are not required to attend the pre-trial festival. However, all competitors MUST attend a team check-in at 7:00PM on Terrador, Aurburnvelle 49. Failure to do so will result in elimination. Members of teams with less than 4 people will have their card automatically reassigned."
4. To the West of Morellus, bordering the Old Stones, a large region of unoccupied plains rests. This is where the Trial of Perseverance will take place. Competitors will be evenly distributed across the plains via teleportation at 7:00 AM, Aequefel, Aurburnvelle 50.
5. The card on your newsletter is what allows this trial to work, and it is embedded on your person as of the beginning of the trial. Combat prior to the start of the trial is strictly forbidden, and will be treated with legal action. Once in the trial, the card is your lifeline. Falling unconscious or being critically wounded will trigger a contingent teleportation spell to the closest hospital where you will be stabilized. After casting said contingent spell, your card will become physical once more, and will fall to the floor for collection by other competitors.
6. The objective of this trial: outlive 50% of the other competitors. If after 5 days pass and more than 50% remain, then the top 50% of teams by order of cards collected proceed to the next trial. Due to the protective properties of the cards, combat is not off limits. Balance both critical thinking and daring decision making to leverage this trial to your will. Show the nation of Morellus what you are made of, and give it your all.
