Session Opening:
Test

"Greetings, gathered adventurers, to the planet of Miravalis. A beautifully expansive world full of rich terrain, peoples, settlements, and immense wild natural magic, pouring into the globe from the fabric of reality itself.

This world is home to nations aplenty, each with their unique demographics, traditions, cultures, and ideals. But for the sake of our story, we will begin in the nation of Morellus, known currently to the world as the Beacon of Hope, and the Pillar of Prosperity, amongst a time of long-awaited reform, a frontier of expansion awaiting you all.

The date is Crepust, Aurburnvelle 37, 1989 P.E, with the official ceremonial commencement of the Royal Crucible beginning in just 3 days on F40. No matter your character, everyone has something to gain from the Crucible, and I mean everyone. It is without a doubt that we are amidst a time of opportunity, competition, and metamorphosis should you choose to take it."

The session will open up with a brief moment for each of their characters to establish their personal goals.

### Tova
Tova will begin his journey in Automata Andreas, with the request of getting more foot traffic towards the shop. Just about a week ago, a rival artificer merchant, Lior Lambert opened a mechanic shop, called Lambert's Parts and Stuff. 

Thaddeus will ask Tova to either investigate the overwhelming success of Lambert, or attract more people to Automata. He also made a sign attachment to fix on Tova, if he so chooses.

### Emil
Emil will wake up to the sounds of fighting in his underdeveloped complex. Under his door will be the next work order from AmpliForge Solutions, detailing a variety of work.

On his way out, he will witness a drug dealing, as well as talk about the Royal Crucible.

### Dvita/Claude
Bright and early, Claude will be awoken by Xavier with an urgent reminder: Orientation at the University is Aurburnvelle 37, in an hour. The university is a 30 minute walk.

At this orientation, Claude will get a grand tour of all of the facilities at the university, including:
- The Morellan Trove of Knowledge
- Knowledge Lane (Statues and Portraits)
- The Grand Exposition Floor (with Clubs)
- The Bestiaries
- Event Avenue
- Parade, featuring the mascot Auric the Galloping Centaur

### Zero
Zero will open up to a busy day at the bar, with morale high from the dawn of the crucible in 3 days. The following events will be witnessed
- A bard off
- An orc arm wrestle
- Darts Championship
- Heated Debate over the validity of the Crucible
- Magic Tricks

He will receive a visit from Taxidus at the start of the session as well, checking in on him and harshly criticizing his tenure of the bar. He will also give him a report on his parents, and ask him his plans for the crucible. He will then teleport away abruptly.

Lawn Layout

Ceremonial Commencement

- The Ceremony will begin with a brief speech from King Ganon.

"Ladies and gentlemen of Morellus, today marks a momentous occasion, a pivotal juncture in our very history! As your King, I stand before you with utmost pride and unwavering conviction, for the Royal Crucible beckons—a grand spectacle that shall define the very essence of our great nation!

In the annals of time, our past was cast in the shadows of exclusivity and privilege, but no more! Today, I stand not as a ruler draped in regal robes, but as a humble servant of the people. It is time to weave a new tapestry, one where the power of governance is entrusted to you—all the people of Morellus!

This Crucible shall be the furnace that reforges our future—a symbol of unity and resilience. Within these trials, we shall forge a beacon of hope that illuminates the hearts of all who reside within our beloved city. Every one of you holds the power to shape the destiny of Morellus—to be crowned as the embodiment of the Crownsguard, or to ascend to the highest echelon as the King, leading our nation to unprecedented prosperity.

Together, let us shatter the chains of the past and embrace the bright horizon of change. Thousands of eyes are upon us, witnessing the moment our nation evolves into a shining example of democracy, pride, and progress. The Royal Crucible shall be a celebration of our collective strength, of our shared aspirations, and our unwavering commitment to the wellbeing of our fortified nation.

So I implore you, fellow citizens, to seize this chance, to lend your talents and dreams to the Crucible's cauldron. The time has come to craft a future that generations shall cherish—a legacy of unity, inspiration, and pride. May the echoes of our determination resound throughout the realms, and may the Royal Crucible become a legacy, a testament to the indomitable spirit of the Morellus people! Embrace your destiny, for together, we shall illuminate the path to a new era of governance—one crafted not by the crown alone, but by the hands and hearts of the entire Morellan People."
