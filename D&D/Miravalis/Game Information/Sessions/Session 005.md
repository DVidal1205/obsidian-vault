**Goal 3: Magifend** DAY 60
"I know you saved my life, but this really is the best I could do. Whatever this Magifend was up to was seriously bad news, and it's records are behind so much paperwork I don't think I could get you all of it by the end of this decade. What I can tell you is this, I have a senior employee who was around from back then - Magifend was a defense contractor for the crown, specializing in - you guessed it - Detricite. But off the books, he rumors that they held some wicked experiments. Like experimenting on people wicked. I'm sorry I have no records to give you, but I will keep digging on this. My suggestion is to ask around, specifically people who could have been around back then. But even from that time, not many were aware of Magifend or the activities they partook in. The only lead I have for you is that Magifend was heavily involved in cutting edge technology, which probably means sanctioned research. My guess is, there is someone at the university who may know something. Perhaps some researchers on Detricite technology may have left some records behind at their archives, which I unfortunately don't have access to."

Current Amplicite Researcher, Descendant of Professor Jax Hoenor, Von Hoenor, a young exuberant researcher.

### Zero
Visited by Taxidus with an update on the status back at home. His parents are doing okay, but some things are getting a bit imbalanced in Rexia. Rumor has it, something fishy is going on with the higher ups.

Interrogated by a private investigator looking into the disappearance of a beloved Canlen Hecra (Insight Check)

Matron teasers
	- "He's Lying"
	- "It disgusts you too, doesn't it?"

Zero will have more nightmares about the events of the trials, and hear the Matrons voice. One of the nights, his nightmares will turn into a conversation.
