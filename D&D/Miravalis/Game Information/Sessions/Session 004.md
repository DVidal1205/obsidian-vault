- Any intelligent approaches will grant advantage
- If the average difference is over 15, that is a critical loss
- If the average difference is greater than 10, the losing team suffers 10 damage
- If the average difference between 5-10, each player on the losing team suffers that much damage.
- If the average difference is between 0-5, it is a stalemate and no damage is traded.
