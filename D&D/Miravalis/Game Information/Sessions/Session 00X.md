## Encounters

### Player Subplots
#### Zero
- Zero will learn of the disappearance of Juggah from his wife, Grishna.
	- They found him not far away from the University Slesa, perhaps a 30 minute walk west.
	- The two plain clothes officers were rude, and only seemed to care about the letter.
	- She noticed the letter had Zero's name on it, and half of an hourglass.
	- He was so close, yet she had no clue.
	- Knows he was doing something good.
- Get a letter from Taxidus:
"Heya kid, Uncle Taxi checking in from the other side of the world. I'd ask how you did on the last trial, but I'm sure you did great. I won't be stopping by for some time, unfortunately there have been some things going on throughout Miravalis that I can't quite explain yet. And if you've gathered anything from me, it's that I refuse to let inexplicable things go unexplained. This has nothing to do with the situation back at home, but rest assured knowing I've been keeping tabs in the motherlands for you too. Let's just say the newest blueprint for that maritime military vessel just happened to go missing last week, that should keep them distracted. Keep up the good work, and you'll see me before you know it."
