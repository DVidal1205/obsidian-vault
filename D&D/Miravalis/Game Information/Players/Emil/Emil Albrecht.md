Utilizing his augmented arm, Emil can assume 2 stances. Switching stances is an interaction, and can only happen once per turn during combat.

Gladiator: Using the enhanced strength of the arm, Emil can use the Detricite arm to single-handedly hold any 2 handed weapon, freeing the other hand for sidearms or various interactions.

Sentinel: By having his arm readily available, Emil can use his reaction to block any magical projectile, reducing its catastrophic effects. As a reaction, impose disadvantage on any magical attack rolls or add his proficiency to any Saving Throw to resist the effects of a magical projectile.
