Xavier Soter is the adoptive father of Claude Soter, [[Dvita Armonia]]'s induced alternate personality. Xavier Soter has connections with the [[The Morellan People for Magical Prosperity (MPMP)]], and worked with them over the second half of his life as an advocacy council member.

He is involved with the [[Morellan Magistrate]] as a legal consultant, and has many connections to [[The Grand Morellan University]] as he graduated from there with a degree in Social Justice Studies.

Xavier, after retiring, missed devoting his time and effort towards bettering people, and what better way to do so than adopt a child. He continues to homeschool his son Claude, and hopes to enroll him in the university this upcoming winter semester.
