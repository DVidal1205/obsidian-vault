### Backstory
Dvita Armonia was born into opulence and privilege, under Devi and Akea Armonia. Devi and Akea ruled over the land known as "Luminaris Vale" in the Feywilds. Luminaris Vale is known as the city of lights, where it is the peak of all life in the Feywilds, with their focus on harnessing light in every way shape and form. His family was at the center of it, the nobility of the kingdom, and the ones who continue the expanse of their great nation.  His family's wealth giving him a sense of entitlement from an early age. Surrounded by servants who catered to his every whim, he grew up believing that the world revolved around him. His upbringing fostered a belief that he was above reproach, and he embraced his role as the center of attention. As he matured, his arrogance solidified into a core part of his personality, and he developed a disdain for anyone he deemed lesser than himself. His interactions often leave people feeling overshadowed and belittled, as he seeks to dominate every social situation and conversation with his overwhelming presence. One day Dvita had been going about his day as an average 90 year old Eladrin, and he had wanted to go view the locals and scoff at them for being poor. He had made it to the central city and while walking across the street with his bodyguard, he was knocked out and taken by a shadowy figure, only recognizable to him by a single tattoo of a burning flame. Dvita had been kidnapped by an organization known as "The Fundamentalists" which wish to harness the elemental magic of the Feywilds, in order to take control of it and open gates to the other realms, and their first step to their goal was the destruction of Lumanaris Vale. For 10 long years Dvita, was kept in isolation from society within a hideout from this organization, where he was never allowed to leave. He was forced to work as a slave for this organization, and was brutally punished if he had failed his tasks, all while the kingdom continued to look for the lost child. The kingdom had lost hope and slowly stopped searching. During this time, Dvita had developed a condition known as "Dissociative Identity Disorder" and he had created an altar known simply as Claude. Dvita's conscious could not handle the stress of being a slave and pushed himself back into his mind, while Claude took over Dvita's mind. Claude became the main host over this body around five years of living this grueling life, and continued to keep his strong will to live, however he had no recollection of his previous life. Claude would only remember scenarios of his life, and who he once was, in his dreams, which would frequently happen. One such recurring dream would be the blaze of a flame that would engulf him, and as a result he had developed a fear of fire as a whole.  Until one fateful day where Claude was taken along with other slaves for the Fundamentalists, to one of the more unstable areas of the Feywilds for work, where Claude was sucked into the material plane by a portal, never to see his past life again. He had wound up in the Old Stones, and stumbled across one of the Markus and Kyle Community Orphanages where he was taken in by nuns that set him up to live a good life. At first Claude was shy and quiet, but then opened up more and started showing his compassionate and caring side, that he used to hide. Claude became popular amongst the other children, and often spent his days reading in the Orphanage library, about magic, being particularly interested in nature magic, as well as a great curiosity about the Feywilds (in actuality this is Dvita behind the scenes influencing Claude's decisions slightly, however Dvita still never shows his face). After only living at the orphanage for a year, Claude is adopted by an older retired gentleman (he is human) who just wanted to raise a child :D, known as Xavier Soter. Xavier in his younger days was an active member of the Morellan People for Magical Prosperity. Xavier was a very talented druid in his younger days, and has been homeschooling Claude for the past four years in this very art. Later Claude took upon the last name of his father, now being known as Claude Soter, and he and his father had fostered a beautiful relationship. They really loved each other and always looked out for each other, and Xavier was preparing Claude to enroll in a proper school, so that he could pursue this passion he loves. Xavier's personality is like Santa Claus :D, just a jolly old man. Claude continues to practice his art of being a druid, and he still gets those dreams about his previous life. It sort of tugs him toward wanting to visit the Old Stones, and why he is so obsessed with wild magic.
### Character Ability
**Warded Psyche**
Having his brain oversaturated with 2 minds, Claude/Dvita will have a general resistance to all things psychic, while the other altar occupies the mind. The body will have advantage on all saving throws against mentally impairing magic. Furthermore, the body has resistance to psychic damage. Lastly, certain spells may work differently when targeting this body, up to the discretion of the Dungeon Master.

Alternatively, Dvita may cast a spell from within the mind once per long rest. After doing so, resistance to psychic damage and advantage on saving throws is undone, resetting on a long rest.
