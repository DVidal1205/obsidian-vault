### Backstory
As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the treetops of the Arboran Commonwealth, a soft hum resonated through the branches. In the heart of the ancient Asteralis trees, Drysalia, the Barkweaver, channeled the mystical energies of the forest to create life. It was in this sacred moment that Tova came into existence. His form, an embodiment of the flora that surrounded him, swayed gently with each whisper of the breeze. From the very beginning, Tova's inquisitive spirit set him apart. Unlike his fellow warforged kin, who tended to remain content within the borders of their lush realm, Tova's thirst for knowledge and understanding was unyielding. The songs of the wind and the wisdom of Drysalia nurtured his natural affinity for music, and the young warforged soon discovered his gift as a bard. His melodies would echo through the towering canopies, captivating mainly small forest creatures, and other Arborans, filling the woodland with comfort. It was in the Arboran Commonwealth that Tova learned the true meaning of harmony, as he embraced the wisdom of Drysalia and the camaraderie of his fellow beings. Yet, the world beyond the Arboran Commonwealth beckoned to him. Tales of distant lands and diverse cultures reached his ears, stirring a deep yearning within him. He knew that there was more to learn, more to experience, and that the diversity he sought might lie beyond the familiar horizons. However, Tova was unable to follow these ambitions due to Drysalia's influence on the Asterborn. This was until a man named Thaddeus Andreas appeared in the Arboran Commonwealth. Suffering below the canopy, Tova came to rescue the human and lead him to his settlement to speak with the Verdant Assembly. Here, Thaddeus confessed he was here to acquire exotic materials for his artificing. Thaddeus was forced to remain in the settlement until the assembly decided on a course of action for him. It was then that Thaddeus decided to modify the Asterborn who saved him. The artificer created a makeshift Amplicite core and detailed Tova, turning him into a sentient creature with free will. With a silent farewell to Drysalia and his kin, Tova set forth on a journey to the land of Morellus alongside Thaddeus. This city was renowned for its acceptance of all races, creeds, and backgroundsâ€”a place where diversity thrived, and one's potential was not bound by origin. Upon his arrival in Morellus, Tova visited Thaddeus' Workshop, where he was further detailed about his current appearance. It was not that Tova did not want to remember his past, more so that he didn't want it to follow him. Thaddeus learned to enjoy Tova's company, as he always provided a helping hand and was a genuine person at heart. As Tova continued to travel the winding paths of Morellus, he shared his unique melodies and tales with everyone he met. His music transcended language barriers, connecting hearts and minds, and forging friendships wherever he wandered. His presence brought joy and solace to those in need, and his deep desire to learn and help others above all else made him a beloved figure to all who met him. Along the way, in exchange for songs and tales, Tova has attempted to try his hand at other skills such as animal kinship, farming, blacksmithing, and whatever else he can get people to teach him. Through Tova's experience learning new skills in Morellus, he determined that he was missing something that all who were fortunate had. A dream. A goal. A thing to strive for. And so his journey continues, driven by the unwavering curiosity that first gave him life, and guided by the inclusivity and compassion that Morellus has shown him, and encouraged by his search for a goal in his everlasting life.
### Custom Items or Abilities
##### Portable Sanctuary
As a 10 minute ritual once per day, Tova can summon his dwelling so long as there is ample space to do so. The size of his sanctuary can range from 10 feet in radius, or 5 * Level feet in radius. 

This Sanctuary can hold up to 10 friendly allies, who can enter in and out freely and cast spells. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other magical effects can't extend through the dome or be cast through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless of the weather outside.

This region can exist for a number of hours equal to your level, and when dispersing, takes all items with it, storing its contents until the point of return.
