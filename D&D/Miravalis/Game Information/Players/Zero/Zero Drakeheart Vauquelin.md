### Backstory
At the age of 11 he was taken into custody by Taxidus, a powerful mage who could teleport and was well traveled. Mage taught him about all sorts of animals and cultures, just bits and pieces though. Even bringing animal parts or texts to help Zero be well-learned and not very short-witted. At the age of 17 he moved into Morellus in one of Taxidus' spare "homes" and at 21 started working the bar.
### Character Ability
**Chameleon's Veil** 
Growing up in Rexia, where deception and subterfuge are valued skills, you have developed the ability to alter your appearance to blend in with your surroundings. Once per long rest, you can use your action to activate the Chameleon's Veil. For the next hour, you gain advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as well as Charisma (Deception) checks made to impersonate someone else, or pass off as a different identity, culture, or heritage.

While the Chameleon's Veil is active, you can also use a bonus action to change your physical appearance to that of a different humanoid of the same size category. This effect lasts until you dismiss it or use the ability again. This transformation does not grant you the abilities or skills of the person you mimic, but it allows you to take on their physical likeness.
