## Description
The Flame-Scaled Goliath stands at an impressive 8 feet tall, its body covered in tough, red scales with flickering flames dancing between them. It wields a large, fiery greatsword that radiates intense heat and its eyes glow a bright, fiery orange. As it moves, it leaves behind a trail of burned earth and scorched grass.
## Lore
Once a member of the Blackrock Family, this Goliath was chosen and transformed by an ancient dragon, imbuing it with the power of fire. In return, the Flame-Scaled Goliath pledged its loyalty to the dragon, now using its powers to aid the Blackrock Family in their quest for dominance. Its towering stature and fiery presence strike fear into the hearts of its enemies.
