# Chain of Command
### Promotion
Once a given unit dies, it is filled by the unit beneath it in the chain of command by means of promotion. If a Secondry is to die, they are replaced my a Momant.
**Gnoxrus Incarnate (All of Time)**
- The Prince of Morellus
- Level 16
- Number: 1
**Ecliptics (Phases of Day)**
- Dusk, Dawn, and Twilight, the strongest soldiers of the Temporal Dread and agents of war and chaos. The Prince's personal protectors, and extremely devoted, perhaps by will, leverage, or deception from the Prince.
- Level 15
- Number: 3 
**Chronarchs (Hours)**
- Incredibly powerful and are enforced by the Ecliptics. Carry out large scale plans, and have 60 Minutemen in their command each.
- Level 12
- Number: 12
**Minutemen (Minutes)**
- Mid tier cultists who report to the Chronarchs. Each minutemen lead a troop of 60 Secondries, and are in charge of spearheading recruitment for the cult in a given district through coercion, persuasion, or spellcasting.
- Level 8
- Number: 360
**Secondries (Seconds)**
- Low tier, yet established cultists who are completely disposable in the name of Gnoxrus. Tasked with brash arcane terror events, as well as the spreading of the fiendish energy of Gnoxrus throughout Morellus.
- Level 5
- Number: 21,600
**Momants (Moments)**
- The lowest tier cultist, recently recruited by one of the Secondries. They are rather weak and newly exposed to the power and mission of Gnoxrus. Momants are unranked and unregulated, and are merely vessels for the power of Gnoxrus to fester. In the event of a promotion, Momants are next in line in order of their power.
- Level 1-4
- Number: Indeterminant
