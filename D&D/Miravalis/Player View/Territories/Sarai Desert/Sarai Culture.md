Devotion is a particularly strong tenet of the people of the [[Sarai Desert]], given the requirement they must meet to reside there. The devotion to [[Setre]] manifests itself in many ways, whether it be through offering, acknowledgement, prayer, or the construction of incredibly large and elaborate temples throughout the lands.
