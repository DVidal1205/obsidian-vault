As the [[Haunted Wilds]] are more of a region than a nation or territory, no formal government stands. It is largely up to the individual community that you accidentally stumble upon, should you go exploring.

Because of the diversity and uniqueness in the wilds, you could probably find all sorts of forms of government. Dictatorships, meritocracies, theocracies, and the likes, but only on a scale of 15 people at most.
