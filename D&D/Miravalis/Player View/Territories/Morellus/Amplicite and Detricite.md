![[Amplicite and Detricite.png]]

The history of these two stones runs deep in the history of [[Morellus]], some good and some bad. First off, Detricite is a rock that can nullify magical properties with incredible precision and power. This rock was used initially by Enifiz Braveheart as a safeguard against the wild magic surges of Miravalis, but roughly 200-300 years into Morellus's existence, the use of Detricite took a rampant turn.

Mages were said to be evil at the time, and with an entire range of magic-nullifying less than 100 miles to the East, the Morellan crown had a mischievous idea. Detricite was used to mass produce weaponry, arming law enforcement with everything they needed to become full-time mage slayers. What was once a rock for building and construction became a material for weapons of an oppressive government. Most notably, "engineers" created a concoction called the Nullifying Brew, which was essentially ground Detricite and other harvested ingredients which was said to "cure" mages. With a 72% fatality rate, it was clear this program was disgusting at best. Because of practices like these, Detricite is seen as ratherâ€¦ bloodstained.

But, in the year 1738, the discovery of a mage engineer named Odra Marves flipped the script on Detricite. Discovering the biological and innate magical properties of Detricite paved way to utilizing it to do the opposite of nullifying, and instead amplifying magic that is stored in it or passes through it. This process was said to create a new substance entirely, known as Amplicite, denoted by a crystalline purple glow within the crystal components of Detricite.

Amplicite soon became the industry standard, and progressed Morellus technologically by leaps and bounds. Taking flight was soon possible with the introduction of mana-powered flight engines. The nation which once took 20+ days to travel from end to end became much smaller with the introduction of automobiles.

Furthermore, Amplicite completely reworked the social hierarchy of magic by stripping the magical away from the mage. Now, everyone can be magical in a sense, with the right purchasing power and drive. This had taken away a large dehumanizing factor to many anti-mages, and helped ease the stigma of magic being destructive and chaotic.
