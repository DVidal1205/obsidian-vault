In this section, I think it is deserving to go over the city composition of [[Morellus]] as well. The nation itself encompasses a large, circular portion of land, with tall Detricite walls fortifying its exterior. In the very center is the Capitol District, and 1/4 semi circle like shapes are formed around it, creating directional districts: [[Northern District]], [[Eastern District]], [[Southern District]], and [[Western District]] respectively. Each of these districts are separated into processes, with each city being a tiered ring of the district handling sub processes.

The Northern and Western districts are the wealthier districts, and merge together nicely. Likewise, the Southern and Eastern districts are slightly poorer and face the greater brunt of the workforce. Because of this, there are many government aid and relief benefits granted to the Southern and Eastern districts, like free high-quality medicine, and free admission to [[The Grand Morellan University]].
