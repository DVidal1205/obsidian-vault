A heavy name in the criminal underworld, The Tinkerer is an incredibly precise and intelligent person who runs [[The Blitz]] - the largest crime syndicate in [[Morellus]]. Yet, their name remains almost undetected from Morellan officials, unable to piece together the correlations between the string of crimes. Furthermore, The Tinkerer is claimed to be the sole inventor of a drug called Blitzpowder through modern feats of biochemical engineering. Some claim they are a former light bringer, others rumor they are a bored person who wanted to try magic for fun. No one knows who The Tinkerer really is, but many would love to find out.Â
