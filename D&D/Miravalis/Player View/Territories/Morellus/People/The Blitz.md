The Blitz is an underground crime syndicate in [[Morellus]], responsible for just about any illegal trade you can think of. And while they don't particularly sell hard crack, they sell their own troublesome drug for the Morellan nation - Blitzpowder. By taking Blitzpowder, non-magic users can become momentarily magical, and magic-users even more volatile. The Blitz is run by a figure of urban myth, deemed The Tinkerer. [[The Tinkerer]]'s identity is unknown, but it is known that they are a very intelligent, sophisticated, and calculated person.
