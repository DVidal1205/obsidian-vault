The Preservationists are a group of Morellan nationalists who will defend [[Morellus]] and its ideals. While not denying the existence of cruelty and injustice, Preservationists claim that it is a necessary evil in preserving the integrity and validity of the great nation of [[Morellus]]. They wish to restore order, back to the days where Morellus limited the use of magic and oppressed mages. Mostly consists of older, more conservative people, who cannot use magic themselves, especially since the new progressions in [[Amplicite and Detricite]].
