[[D&D/Miravalis/Player View/Territories/Morellus/People/King Ganon]], [[Queen Sejua]], [[Prince Sylna]], [[Princess Jaedra]], and [[Heir Miara]] (recently deceased) make up the current royal family. The current face of the nation is a family of Elvish decent. The Luminara Family are actually rather caring of the people and have advocated for some of the more progressive ideology in [[Morellus]].
