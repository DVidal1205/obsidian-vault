The nation of [[Morellus]] is established in a large plain that gains great defense from the geography surrounding it. Savanah and dessert to the North and South, [[Amplicite and Detricite]] Mountains to East, and thick forest to the West. The land is fertile year-round and can support an abundance of people. These plains are also conveniently atop many deposits of viable minerals and ores, giving Morellus an incredible advantage in industrialization. The Amplicite and Detricite mountains are also crucial to the fortification of Morellus, and can be read about more in the Amplicite and Detricite page.

The Clay Mesa to the North is not formally a territory of Morellus, but instead is home to a civilization of mages known as the [[Claystone Mages]]. Morellus has multiple diplomatic agreements with the Claystone, as they are a form of defense against nautical sieges from [[Rexia]] across Deadman's Pass. This diplomatic agreement was heavily criticized by the people of Morellus for its hypocrisy during their oppressive era towards mages, but has since loosened and become more mutually beneficial towards both territories.
