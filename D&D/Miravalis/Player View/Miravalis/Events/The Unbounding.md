On Year 1738, Aurburnvelle 17, the largest scale event on the planet [[Miravalis]], the Unbounding was the last and final rise of the ancient evil [[Gnoxrus]], from deep within the [[Amplicite and Detricite]] mountains where he was trapped. With his allies, [[Revelare Ammortis]], and [[Darius the Dreadful]] slain by [[The Legendary Crownsguard]] of [[Morellus]], he was at a serious disadvantage. Volleyed by combatants from around the globe (from regions including the [[Old Stones]], [[Dragonhide Summits]], [[Haunted Wilds]], [[Arboran Commonwealth]], and [[Morellus]]). He was defeated, but not without a significant amount of casualties. The mountains to the East of Morellus now became a ravine, a crater of the evil monstrosity that once laid there.
