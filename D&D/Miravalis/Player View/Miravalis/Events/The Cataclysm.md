On Year 420, Verflora 69, a violent shift was observed in the world of [[Miravalis]], by which the single-continent planet shifted tremendously in a short amount of time, separating [[Rexia]] from the mainland and relocating many previously-establish civilizations. Wild magical effects were also observed all over the continent during this day. The only exceptions to these phenomena were the [[Amplicite and Detricite]] Mountains to the East of present-day [[Morellus]] and [[Lake Arbor]]. These natural magical effects were deemed "Divine Judgement," others argue that this was a demonstration of the worlds power, others think it was a mere coincidence. These effects can still be observed periodically in The [[Haunted Wilds]].
