+ Year 0, Hibernara 0
+ The Worlds Origin
+ The theorized formation of the world according to contemporary historians. A season of raging snowstorms overtook the entire planet of Miravalis at even the warmest climate zones. These storms were paired with violent magical surges like no other, as well as devastating earthquakes. If there was any recorded history before this, it was long destroyed. And as for the historians, they'd be lucky if they froze in their sleep. However, some modern day historians believe there was ancient civilization that existed far before Year 0, and that this was the work of the entity known as [[Gnoxrus]], who once claimed to have ended the world many times over before. Still, agreeing to this tormenting storm as Year 0 still remains the best course of action.

+ Year 1, Verflora 37
+ The Old Stones Emerges
+ Almost suddenly, a plain of grasslands violently shifted in its composition, as nature poured itself onto the blank canvas. Observed by natives of the [[Old Stones]], trees began flourishing rapidly throughout the region, particularly in the Northwest, establishing the first treacherous landmark of the territory, the [[Forest Unyielding]].

+ Year 16, Solcanicula 64
+ Lake Arbor Appears
+ Carving itself into existence, a magical lake known as [[Lake Arbor]] appears in the [[Old Stones]]. This very lake is said to be the origin point of all magic in [[Miravalis]], but then one begs to differ, what magic spawned the lake? To this day, this lake holds many rumors and mysteries waiting to be uncovered by the brave adventurer.

+ Year 47, Auburnvelle 12
+ The Hidden Halls Established
+ The Tower is raised in The [[Hidden Halls]]. The [[Forest Unyielding]] becomes aware, with a spirit in every tree and plant. The first non-native people reach [[Old Stones]] through what will one day be [[Morellus]]. They are greeted by a stranger in grey, and eventually become the nine druid sects that guard the Forest.

+ Year 52, Verflora 21
+ Claystone Mage Civilization Formed
+ The oldest recorded collective organization, the [[Claystone Mages]], was formed in the Year 52. Banding together by the collective need to survive harsh conditions, those gifted in the arcane arts discovered the magical properties of the clay embedded in this region. Banding together a civilization with the knowledge and vision of this clay, the Claystone Mages were officially established.

+ Year 134, Aurburnvelle 47
+ Communities Erupt in the Haunted Wilds
+ The first humanoids begin to settle in the [[Haunted Wilds]], despite the heavy presence of fiends in the area. Small disapora begin to sprawl across the forest, gathering around [[Styx Peak]]. Five years later on Verflora 9, the [[Clearwater]] community emerges.

+ Year 248, Verflora 35
+ Dragonhide Peoples Embrace Nomadism 
+ Learning from their mistakes, the people of the [[Dragonhide Summits]] begin to grasp that the native dragons do not hate them, but their architectural desecration of their savannah homeland. This marks the turn in humanoid prosperity in the summits, and the formation of friendships between man and dragon.

+ Year 393, Solcanicula 46
+ The Founding of Rexia
+ After a few decades of morons running an uninhabited land amuck, the first organized group of Rexian settlers arose. The mightiest of men, led by [[Rex the Earnest]] established the first territory on the north of the mainlands of [[Miravalis]], named [[Rexia]] after the leader of the group. This nation will continue to cause problems for the rest of the globe for centuries to come, or so they thought.

+ Year 420, Verflora 69
+ The Cataclysm
+ A violent shift was observed in the world of [[Miravalis]], by which the single-continent planet shifted tremendously in a short amount of time, separating [[Rexia]] from the mainland and relocating many previously-establish civilizations. Wild magical effects were also observed all over the continent during this day. The only exceptions to these phenomena were the [[Amplicite and Detricite]] Mountains to the East of present-day [[Morellus]] and [[Lake Arbor]]. These natural magical effects were deemed "Divine Judgement," others argue that this was a demonstration of the worlds power, others think it was a mere coincidence. These effects can still be observed periodically in The [[Haunted Wilds]].

+ Year 489, Solcanicula 11
+ The Starless Swamps Lose Light
+ Once a normal old marsh, the disastrous magic found in present day [[Starless Swamps]] begins to appear after festering for decades since [[The Cataclysm]]. No one dares enter these swamps, and its existence began to cause trouble for nearby settlements along its border in the [[Arboran Commonwealth]] and [[Dragonhide Summits]]

+ Year 572, Verflora 44
+ Founding of Morellus
+ Visionary [[Enifiz Braveheart]] rallied together the civilizations in the former Heavenly Plains and founded the city of [[Morellus]]. By convincing others of his vision, and with his newfound discovery of Detricite (now [[Amplicite and Detricite]], he promised these people a safe-haven from the same unruly earthen magic that flipped the world upside down during [[The Cataclysm]].

+ Year 647, Verflora 72
+ The Arboran Ascend
+ After over 200 years of land-dwelling and facing off against the monsters that pour into the [[Arboran Commonwealth]] from planar rifts, the people of the region ascend the [[Asteralis]] trees that sprawl across the forest. Discovering their magically fortifying properties, communities begin to form hundreds of feat in the air, and technology finally propels. 

+ Year 895, Hibernara 12
+ Claystone-Morellan Treaty
+ The [[Claystone-Morellan Treaty]] was a formal diplomatic agreement signed between The [[Claystone Mages]] and [[Morellus]]. This agreement allowed Morellan to establish three coastal port, [[The Grand Morellan Ports]], in exchange for an influx in modern technology and support from [[Rexia]] and its conquests. However, at the time this treaty was heavily criticized by both Morellan and Claystone people.

+ Year 1212, Hibernara 36
+ Arboran Mythal Achieved
+ After hundreds of years of culmination, the people of the [[Arboran Commonwealth]] finally achieve peace after masking the treetop cities presence from the monsters below using a Mythal. This marks a heavy turnpoint in the Arboran, as culture and technology flourish from dedicated less time towards defense and survival.

+ Year 1722, Solcanicula 66
+ Revelare's Rebellion
+ Causing great social uproar, the infamous anarchist and visionary [[Revelare Ammortis]] escapes [[Morellus]] royal prison and kills 14 of [[The Watchers (former)]] in the process, as well as spreading his rhetoric to the commonfolk of Morellus. This ideology spread quickly, and soon formed the existence of the [[Liberation Mages (former)]] in Morellus

+ Year 1730, Verflora 19
+ Darius the Dreadful Rises to Power
+ At the age of 22, [[Darius the Dreadful]]] rose his oversized Great axe and beheaded the previous ruler, Victor the Violent. This started an era for [[Rexia]] known as the Darian Age, signifying a great boost in overseas territorial gain and dirty plays. The first ever Rexian siege made it to the mainlands under the rule of Darius, attempting to take territory in the Northern shore of the [[Haunted Wilds]]. Mysteriously, though, all vessels disappeared after making landfall.

+ Year 1738, Hibernara 45
+ The Battle that Never Happened
+ According to a large group in [[Morellus]], an ancient evil known as [[Gnoxrus]] had begun a siege on Morellus. These four spoke of a war between [[Morellus]] and the [[Dragonhide Summits]] against [[Gnoxrus]], [[Rexia]], and the [[Starless Swamps]]. This was an incredibly gruesome battle, with Rexia flanking Morellus from the north and the Starless Swamps sieiging the southeast with a fleet of aberrations led by [[Revelare Ammortis]]. However, the valiant efforts of [[King Ganon]] rallied Morellus together, nearly killing Gnoxrus. However, using a large strenous burst of his mana, he rewound the day, leaving only these travelers with their memories. But, they did warrant some merit, as this vision turned the tides of the battle, with the four eventually ending up as [[The Legendary Crownsguard]] of Morellus.

+ Year 1738, Verflora 18
+ Darius the Dreadful Slain
+ Only 8 years into power, [[Darius the Dreadful]] is slain by [[The Legendary Crownsguard]] of [[Morellus]] in an undermining of power due to his allegiance and patronage of the ancient evil [[Gnoxrus]]. This was due to the foresight they gained from witnessing [[The Battle that Never Happened]]

+ Year 1738, Solcanicula 7
+ Revelare Ammortis Slain
+ Hiding in the [[Starless Swamps]], [[Revelare Ammortis]] was working for the ancient evil [[Gnoxrus]], raising an army of tormented souls to achieve his ultimate goal: the destruction of [[Morellus]]. This was short lived, though, as he was killed by the [[The Legendary Crownsguard]] of Morellus. However, his army of aberrations still rose on the day of the Unbounding, a season later.

+ Year 1738, Aurburnvelle 17
+ The Unbounding
+ The largest scale event on the planet [[Miravalis]], the Unbounding was the last and final rise of the ancient evil [[Gnoxrus]], from deep within the [[Amplicite and Detricite]] mountains where he was trapped. With his allies, [[Revelare Ammortis]], and [[Darius the Dreadful]] slain by [[The Legendary Crownsguard]] of [[Morellus]], he was at a serious disadvantage. Volleyed by combatants from around the globe (from regions including the [[Old Stones]], [[Dragonhide Summits]], [[Haunted Wilds]], [[Arboran Commonwealth]], and [[Morellus]]). He was defeated, but not without a significant amount of casualties. The mountains to the East of Morellus now became a ravine, a crater of the evil monstrosity that once laid there.

+ Year 1739, Hibernara 1
+ The Luminara Age Begins
+ After the events of [[The Unbounding]], [[King Ganon]] took upon the task of correcting the past issues of hate running in [[Morellus]] due to the mental influence of hate and destruction from [[Gnoxrus]] to the East. Many reforms were made with the idea of social and economic equity, as well as acknowledging and correcting the anti mage sentiment in [[Morellus]]. This day was the beginning of many legal corrections, as well as the retirement of [[The Watchers (former)]] and [[The Formidable Five (former)]], rebranding them into more open and safe organizations, [[The Ivory Wardens]] and [[The Morellan Crownsguard]] respectively. 

+ Year 1777
+ Amplicite Propels Morellus
+ With the newfound applications of Detricite, now reversed engineered into Amplicite by engineer [[Odra Marves]], [[Morellus]] has made leaps and bounds in technology. The year 1777 marks the invention of both the automobile, and a prototype for aeronatuical travel. The capabilities of both [[Amplicite and Detricite]] will be continuously studied at [[The Grand Morellan University]] and by [[Lightbringers]] for centuries to come.

+ Year 1989, Aurburnvelle 45
+ The Royal Crucible Begins
+ Due to his approaching of old age, [[King Ganon]] has decided to establish a series of ritualistic trials to transfer the crown to the people of [[Morellus]], abandoning the monarchy established before him. These trials will be a true testiment to meritocracy, and a true marvel for the rest of the world.
