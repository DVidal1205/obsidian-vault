# Session Summary
## Session Duration: Aurburnvelle 37 - Aurburnvelle 40
Session 001 opened with the parties various daily lives. Spanning over three days, the players performed tasks normal to their lives, before Aurburnvelle 40, the Royal Crucible Commencement. There, a terrorist attack engulfed the lawn of people in chaos. With the help of the Morellan people, and Crownsguard Members Wayara and Wolfe, the situation is contained, but not before claiming 34 civilian lives. This was a catastrophic event of terror, and the only clue left behind was a cryptic symbol appearing to be some time of cylindrical chamber.
