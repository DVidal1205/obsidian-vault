# Session 008 and 009 Summary
## Session Duration: Hibernara 6 - Hibernara 10
The party continues forth through the remaining challenges of the Northern district, cooking exquisite meals in Howulâ€™s kitchen, the fourth of five trials in the North. 

After prepping various dishes, the parties attention is stolen by slight rumbling echoing southeast of the kitchen. Exiting the establishment, they see a spire of red smoke and a fleeing crowd of civilians. 

Springing to action, the party runs towards the detonation site and engages the cultist who caused the explosion, along with 10 Ivory Wardens. Saving 12 of the contestants, Emil and Claude, now known as Dr. Bear, are heroes. And after Zero scorching that bastard cultist to ash, the party refocuses to saving the civilians trapped in another scene of conflict. A new face, Vouhi, rushes to the aid of the trapped civilians alongside Tova. After dismissing the cultist guarding the Glyph Wall of Force and entering the fray, the party gets some hits on the main cultist of the attack. Eventually, Veroah enters, quickly dispatching the cultist and detaining him.

In the aftermath, Vouhi, along with Blark, make acquaintance with the party. Moving forward, these six contestants complete the remaining challenges in the trial of judgement:

Northern District:
- a Black Friday brawl in Golsona Square

Southern District:
- various farming tasks, obstacle courses, and maize monster melee

Western District:
- intellectually enriched tasks, including debate, engineering, and painting

Capitol District:
- a grand 45+ mile race, with appearances from 4 of the 5 Crownsguard members

After completing the race, the party now enters their 25 days of downtime. 

### Other Developments
- Tova and Emil want to start an anti-establishment rebel group?
- Vouhi lasts 2 minutes in bed
- Dr. Bear reigns infamous in the medical world
- Zero REALLY loves fire (and alcohol)
