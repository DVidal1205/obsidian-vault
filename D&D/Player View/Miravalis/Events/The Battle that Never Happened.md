On Year 1738, Hibernara 45, according to a large group in [[Morellus]], an ancient evil known as [[Gnoxrus]] had begun a siege on Morellus. These four spoke of a war between [[Morellus]] and the [[Dragonhide Summits]] against [[Gnoxrus]], [[Rexia]], and the [[Starless Swamps]]. This was an incredibly gruesome battle, with Rexia flanking Morellus from the north and the Starless Swamps sieiging the southeast with a fleet of aberrations led by [[Revelare Ammortis]]. However, the valiant efforts of [[King Ganon]] rallied Morellus together, nearly killing Gnoxrus. However, using a large strenous burst of his mana, he rewound the day, leaving only these travelers with their memories. But, they did warrant some merit, as this vision turned the tides of the battle, with the four eventually ending up as [[The Legendary Crownsguard]] of Morellus.
