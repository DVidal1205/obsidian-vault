# Power System Patch
### Vigoria Changes
The initial drop of Vigoria held some excellent flavor but lacked a mechanical wow factor. To fix this, I targeted the use of Vigoria abilities, and having a much more consistent increase for all things physical.

**Level 5**
- 10ft Bonus to all move speeds, +2 AC, 3x PPL (3x Base)
- Adds advantage to all Dexterity, Constitution, and Strength saving throws
- Removed jump ability as it was complicated
**Level 10**
- 10ft Bonus to all move speeds, +2 AC, 5x PPL (15x Base)
- Damage: advantage on melee attacks
- Changed damage sponge to 20% max hit points instead of 10 damage to account for scaling and HP imbalances between martial classes (monk should not tank like a barb does)
- Removes constitution advantage (added to level 5)
- Adds the ability to cost Vigoria abilities at half cost (If you are able to cast them at full cost)
**Level 15**
- 20ft Bonus to all move speeds, +3 AC, 10x PPL (150x Base)
- Damage: additional damage dice tp melee damage rolls
- Change the bonus to CON and STR/DEX
- Remove critical hit ability
- Remove expertise
**Level 20**
- 20ft Bonus to all move speeds, +3 AC, 25x PPL (3750x Base)
- Damage: additional damage dice to melee damage rolls
- Allows for infinite use of Vigoria abilities with a base cost less than 32
- Increase CON and STR/DEX by another 2 points
- Added the ability to add Strength or Dexterity mod to HP calculations
**Ability: Devastating Blow**
- Changed the additional damage from half total Vigoria points to total Vigoria points
**Ability: Frightful Presence**
- Added the Frightful Presence ability that will unlock at level 14
**Ability: Flash Step**
- Increased the attack bonus to flash stepping behind an enemy to max damage

### Ethernova Changes
Ethernova was a little strong, and some of the abilities did not make sense flavor wise and overstepped into the realm of Vigoria and Astravera.
**Level 5**
- Removed disadvantage on initiative
- Added advantage on perception and insight
**Level 10**
- Changed the number of advantage rolls to proficiency bonus to modify scaling
**Level 15** 
- Changed the amount of temporary HP to proficiency bonus to account for the changed amount of ability casts 
**Level 20**
- Reduced AC increase to +2
- Changed the flying speed to 60ft, rather than base times 2
