Stemming from the powerful natural magic of [[Miravalis]], inhabitants of this planet have learned to harness this untapped potential in a variety of ways. Organizing itself into three main categories, the raw energy flooding Miravalis is converted by its peoples into Astravera, Vigoria, and Ethernova, and presents itself in a variety of ways and styles. While subclasses may deviate the current arrangement, and many exceptions are present, the diagram above may help get a better idea of which styles fall into which energies.

### Astravera
Similar to the concept of mana or arcane energy, Astravera is the measure of a persons ability to manipulate the magic potential of the environment around them. Those gifted and trained in manipulating Astravera will most typically be spellcasters, weaving the fabric of reality to bend to their will.
