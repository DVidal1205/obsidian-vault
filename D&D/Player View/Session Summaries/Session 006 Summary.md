# Session 006 Summary
## Session Duration: Aurburnvelle 75 - Hibernara 05

This session, the party wrapped up the last 5 days of their downtimes and began the first day of the Trial of Judgement. 

After meeting at the Broken Barstool by the influence of Tova, the party got a good nights rest before traveling to the capitol district at 5 in the morning, arriving on time for the first clue. After deducing the locale of the first day to be in the Eastern District, the party secures a cart with the help of Emil, and secured it with a 75gp purchase from Zero. They gain a significant lead by Claude's cleverness, using enhance ability on the horse who pulls the heavy cart with ease.

Arriving, the party completed the following challenges:
- Challenge 1/5 - Industrial Convergence
	- The party arrived at a warehouse and was tasked with moving 4 heavy 7x7ft. tungsten boxes, which weighed nearly 1,000 pounds.
	- By shopping for various parts at nearby warehouses, the party assembled a cart which they used to transport all 4 boxes at once.
- Challenge 2/5 - Blacksmith's Gauntlet
	- The party navigated to a local wares vendor who Zero knew from his time in the East, who tipped the party off towards a blacksmith who closed up shop for the 5 days. They arrived at a blacksmith shop which Emil got his new club polearm from.

- Challenge 4/5 - Forge Frenzy
	- The party entered a long forge-like hallway filled with fire elementals.
	- Claude is escorted by the party in order to stay mentally sane due to his fear of fire.
