# Session 003 Summary
## Session Duration: Aurburnvelle 50 - Aurburnvelle 51
Starting the first day of the trial, the parties go on their way with their respective teams. Team Restraint fights Team Harmony in a series of woods to the West of the battlefield, successfully eliminating Team Harmony. 

Unfortunately, team Restraint angers the Awakened Trees that call this forest home, causing a full out brawl among the trees. They escape, and encounter Team Trove and Team Detricite who had traveled there after noticing the commotion. There, old friends are reunited as Zero and Tova wave each other down, and Eldrin, Gearbox, Gerbo, and Mortem all express their comraderies. 

Tova deescalates the brawls among the trees, and introduces them to American Football. Pleased by this newfound entertainment, they agree to protect the 12 individuals in the forest.

The issue at hand is now a 12 person team, how to distribute cards, but more primarily, how to trust each other. In his cunning, Mortem suggests the teams recompose themselves into subsets of each group as a trust exercise. Half of team Detricite, and the two halves of Team Trove and Team Restraint head out to hunt while the party set's up camp. Upwards of 8 hours pass, and the parties do not return.

Receiving a letter in his sentry form, Mortem reveals to Tova his plan from the start, and announces the fact that changing cards is possible. By Eliminating Team Detricite, Gearbox, Gerbo, Mortem, and Eldrin all assume their team name. Mailing back a Harmony card to the party, they now have 4 of the same card to change to. The party now fights under the name of Team Harmony.

The new formed party has to say goodbye to their forest domain, as a Blizzard sweeps in. However, before they leave, they are presented with 3 more cards collected from trespassers. On their way out, they are ambushed by a party of 3, avenging their lost teammate and losing.

The party continues towards a cave, descends it, passes a gelatinous cube, and eventually runs into a pair of Cave Dwellers. Zero collects his rope of climbing, and the party carries on with their life.
