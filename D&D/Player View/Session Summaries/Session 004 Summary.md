# Session 004 Summary
## Session Duration: Aurburnvelle 52 - Aurburnvelle 52
This session, the party picks up on their valiant efforts to conquering the Trial of Perseverance. After finding refuge in the awakened forest, they were stormed out due to inclement weather and found refuge in a deep cavern instead. Deep below a nearby mountain, the party passed various threats, but none of them held a torch to the malicious energy deep beneath the land. 

After experiencing a flashing surge of devious energy, Zero and Emil begin feeling dread washing over them, and observe themselves aging rapidly. This fear turned into a reality for Zero, who began feeling an unbearable pain. With the help of Tova's quick thinking and Claude's brashness, Zero is snapped out of his condition. Emil is a hard baller, and needs no help. 

They descend towards the malicious energy, noticing cryptic marks and scratches along the cave walls, increasing in concentration further down. There, they find the scarred cultist Zero encountered. Once seeking vengeance, this man now seems content and thankful for Zero "giving him an opportunity at a second chance," after claiming to be "rejected by him." After deluding, he inevitably kills himself, smiling back at Zero as he watches.

The party then heads towards their awakened forest friends, only to find them tired from the blizzard hibernation. After waiting around for them to wake up, the party notices 4 people sleeping in the snow. Tova boxes them like its Fortnite, and Emil tosses the outlier into the box. They beckon for their life as Tova becomes a mafia boss, until a Half-Elf among their ranks misty steps out and gives up their cards. He dies swiftly though, as the Transfigured Beast approaches the party. Tova acts quickly, sending the beast after the opposing team using Suggestion, giving the party time to think.

The party observes the beast withholding its attacks until its target gives up, and theorizes they could use Zero as bait. This fails after he is grappled, and Tova resorts to plan B. Smearing the blood of the creatures kills across an Amplicite stone, he creates a bomb and calls for it to strike. Briefly losing his arm, Tova sacrifices himself to feed the beast the charged rock, killing it upon detonation. The party is then transferred back to the university, concluding the end of the competition and elimination of 50% of the competitors.
