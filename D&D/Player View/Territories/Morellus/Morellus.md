Morellus, also known to [[Miravalis]] as the Beacon of Hope, is the central most nation to the mainlands of the planet. This nation is home to many marvelous figures and inventions, and is world renown for its level of technology, education, and inclusivity. However, Morellus was not always this way. Long ago, an Ancient Evil known as Gnoxrus sat beneath the Detricite Mountain Range, influencing the Morellan Crown to persecute mages for many, many years.

The founder of Morellus, Enifiz Braveheart established Morellus on the back of Detricite, a mighty stone that has the ability to nullify magic. During large wild magic surges, Enifiz lost his family, and saw the volatility of the planet's magic. And thus, Morellus was born, a safe haven from all magical phenomena.

And while his vision was misconstrued, Morellus returns to its inspired and revolutionary state over the last 250 years, which contemporary historians call the Luminaran Age, marked by the rule of King Ganon Luminara. Since the defeat of Gnoxrus during [[The Unbounding]], the King has done excellent at reforming the nation to become a place for all, including mages.
