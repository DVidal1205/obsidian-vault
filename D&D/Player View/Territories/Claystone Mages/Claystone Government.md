Diplomatically, the [[Claystone Mages]] are an ally of [[Morellus]], and have been for hundreds of years. At first, this was a parasitic relationship made out of fear, given Morellus's deep rooted hate of mages. The treaty was made due to the value of the Mages geography, being the closest shoreline to Morellus, giving them access to experimenting with maritime tech to rival [[Rexia]]. The Claystone Mages also do their best to make the natural conditions of Deadman's Pass even more deadly, hoping to keep Rexia far away for the rest of time.

As for a formal government, the Claystone Mages are relatively decentralized. With a lawful good alignment for the territory as a whole, a large government has not really been necessary for the mages. Instead, many small enclaves and cities form, each with a town center and marketplace.
