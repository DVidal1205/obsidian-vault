A diplomatic treaty between [[Morellus]] and the [[Claystone Mages]]. The treaty was heavily criticized upon its formation, due to the anti-mage sentiment in Morellus at the time, despite allying with a settlement of mages. 

This treaty established large ports, also known as [[The Grand Morellan Ports]] along the northern shore of the settlement, or [[Deadman's Pass]]. This treaty was enacted as a collaborative effort to give Morellus access to maritime experimentation, with the sole hope of keeping [[Rexia]] at bay.

This treaty was significantly reformed under the guidance of [[King Ganon]] and the [[Luminaran Age]], modifying the conditions of the treaty. This also replaced [[The Watchers (former)]] with [[The Ivory Wardens]], and was far less imposing.
