Fighting in the frontline of [[Morellus]] during [[The Unbounding]], Carlos is a father like figure to [[Emil Albrecht]]. He migrated to the [[Haunted Wilds]] to retire after 50 years of serving in [[The Morellan Crownsguard]] and receiving his Detricite prosthesis from Magifend, created by the legendary Professor Jax of [[The Grand Morellan University]]. He is well known by his era, which was from 1790-1840

- Physical Features: Tall and broad-shouldered with a weathered, but strong physique. Carlos has a salt-and-pepper beard, and his once dark hair is now streaked with gray, lending him an air of wisdom and experience. His eyes are a warm, deep brown, and they reflect the hardships and triumphs of his long life.

- Quirks: Carlos has a habit of polishing his Detricite prosthesis whenever he's deep in thought or reminiscing about his past battles. He often carries a worn, leather-bound journal where he jots down memories and sketches of the landscapes he has explored.

- Fun Facts: Carlos is an avid storyteller, and his tales of daring adventures and heroic deeds are legendary among those who know him. Despite his imposing presence on the battlefield, he has a soft spot for animals and can often be found befriending creatures in the Haunted Wilds. He has a favorite spot in the forest, where he goes to meditate and find peace amidst the tranquility of nature. Carlos has a collection of old maps and artifacts from his days in the Crownsguard, and he enjoys sharing them with others, passing on knowledge and history to the younger generation.
