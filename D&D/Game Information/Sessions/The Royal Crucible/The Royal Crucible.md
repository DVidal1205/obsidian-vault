# Trials
### Trial of Perseverance (I)
(1,007,112 -> 503,556) 
1. This is a five day trial that will test competitors abilities to work together, make calculated decisions, comprehensive combat skills, and survival capabilities.
2. This is a team event, and your assigned team of 4 has been attached to this card.
3. Competitors are not required to attend the pre-trial festival. However, all competitors MUST attend a team check-in at 7:00PM on Terrador, Aurburnvelle 49. Failure to do so will result in elimination. Members of teams with less than 4 people will have their card automatically reassigned."
4. To the West of Morellus, bordering the Old Stones, a large region of unoccupied plains rests. This is where the Trial of Perseverance will take place. Competitors will be evenly distributed across the plains via teleportation at 7:00 AM, Aequefel, Aurburnvelle 50.
5. The card on your newsletter is what allows this trial to work, and it is embedded on your person as of the beginning of the trial. Combat prior to the start of the trial is strictly forbidden, and will be treated with legal action. Once in the trial, the card is your lifeline. Falling unconscious or being critically wounded will trigger a contingent teleportation spell to the closest hospital where you will be stabilized. After casting said contingent spell, your card will become physical once more, and will fall to the floor for collection by other competitors.
6. The objective of this trial: outlive 50% of the other competitors. If after 5 days pass and more than 50% remain, then the top 50% of teams by order of cards collected proceed to the next trial. Due to the protective properties of the cards, combat is not off limits. Balance both critical thinking and daring decision making to leverage this trial to your will. Show the nation of Morellus what you are made of, and give it your all.
### Trial of Judgement (II)
Greetings competitors of the great Royal Crucible. Congratulations on emerging triumphant from the first trial, and getting the grand opportunity of proceeding to the next. In five days from now, Hibernara 5, the second of the challenges will commence - the Trial of Judgement. The rules for the trial of judgement are as follows:
1. This is another five day trial, in which competitors will have their critical thinking skills tested throughout the Morellan homelands.
2. A series of clues will lead competitors all throughout the nation of Morellus. Scattered about, hiding in plain site, are a series of sub challenges that competitors must complete to receive the next clue. Each day, roughly 30,000 competitors will be eliminated assuming full attendance. At the end of each of the five days, clues will freeze, creating a grace period before the next day. Because of this, the trial of Judgement will not end before the fifth day.
3. This trial will favor those who are able to think on their feet, and leverage their judgement skills to isolate solutions as fast as possible. This trial will also favor those who are resourceful, as the challenges will be dispersed throughout all sorts of environments within Morellus. Lastly, this trial may  test your knowledge of Morellus, and your ability to take in the rich culture of the nation on the fly.
4. While this is not explicitly a teamed event, teamwork will not be punished. However, keep in mind that the number of competitors who may proceed is limited, and thus, a team may be forced to cut losses at any point during the trial.
The trial will begin with competitors in the Capitol District around the Luminaran Estate. Clues will begin revealing themselves to you at 9:00AM. To receive these clues, you must be sure to keep this letter handy, as the text will update as the challenges go on. Good luck competitors, and fight for your right to rule the beautiful nation of Morellus.
