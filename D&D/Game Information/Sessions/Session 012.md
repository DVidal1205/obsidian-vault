#### Thoss Memory
*Waiting outside of some alleyway, fidgeting with a knife of some sorts, at mid day*

*Juggah opens a hatch, that seeming appears from the ground, and exiting from the tunnels, disheveled.*

Dorban: He's clearly exhausted. I know he probably caused some trouble in there, but look at him. Maybe we should take-

*Thoss stabs him in the lower abdomen.*

Dorban: see Thoss, sometimes your cold cunning precise act doesn't always get the job done you know.

Juggah: ITS GOING TO TAKE A LOT MORE THAN THAT TO-

*Dorban stomps straight into the handle of the dagger, splintering off a piece of Juggahs side. He does this repeatedly, until Juggah grabs his leg, and Dorban pivots to the face*

Dorban: Clean this up. And save the body for family. Random disappearances make for people with vendettas, and people with vendettas are nosy. I'll meet back up with you at the morgue tomorrow, I have that meeting with our handler tonight. Don't be late

*Thoss continues to marvel at the dagger and the blood*




Those in the tunnel will spend the following 6 days trying to leave. If they lose, Dorban will have pity. If they lose to Thoss, they may be saved by passerby's. 
## Tunneling
- Thaddeus will continue to tunnel and build the hideout, which will complete on H-30

## Professor Von Jax (H-30)
- Emil will receive the following reports about the studies on his Detricite Prosthesis:
- Von will be thoroughly impressed by his binding ability, and will be particularly shocked by how it was not made for him initially.
- THE BOX CONTAINING THE DOCUMENTS WILL HAVE THE CROWNSGUARD CREST ON IT

*Order Receipt (213 Years Ago)*
Order Number: 7839-5210-4567-1023. 
Date: Hibernara 12, 1777
Recipient: Carlos Oknar
Age: 129
Order Details: the subject, Carlos, has been a rising member of the Morellus Militia for some time now. His progression and resolve are particularly shocking, given the fact that he has spent the last 39 years training without a left arm. He seeks to utilize such an augmentation to its fullest, battle-testing the capabilities of my current model, by which I have agreed. King Ganon, or some other quill-pusher, seems personally invested in this, as the cost of this installment was entirely waived by the crown. I find this case particularly intrigued, and as such, I have scheduled him to return to the lab a year from now to measure calibration performance. 

*Case Study: Detricite Prosthesis #184*
Observations: Carlos, against all odds, has shown incredible levels of attunement to the prosthesis. Perhaps it is his resolve, or perhaps the absence of Gnoxrus and the recomposition of the mineral after the events of the Cataclysm, but it seems I have made a breakthrough. This marvelous performance is exciting, and right on time for the unfortunate passing of Kyle Smith. Shall this wonderful subject reach for the stars, and make this great nation proud as one of the Morellan Crownsguard 

*Crownsguard Entry: Carlos Oknar*
Carlos Oknar, the 6th sworn Morellan Crownsguard since the turning of the Luminaran Age, is a man of inspiration. Fighting alongside our mighty Morellan heroes on the Eastern forefront of the Unbounding of 1738, Carlos defended our nation with pride. Unfortunately, though, he did not do so without incurring injury. Due to a debilitating injury inflicted at the final lengths of the battle, Carlos had to receive an emergency amputation. 

Despite being untrained by any formal agency or militia, Carlos continued to urge for protecting his country. As soon as he was healed, he continued to train, and eventually enlisted among the Ivory Warden. Unsatisfied with his one-armed abilities, he contracted the help of Professor Brunwick Jax, esteemed interdisciplinary researcher with a focus on Detricite and Anatomy. Constructing a prosthesis for Carlos, Dr. Jax gave him the gift of excellence. He continued to climb the ranks of the militia, eventually taking the vacancy of Crownsguard, fighting alongside the Legendary members of the Crownsguard, Hugh Namiri, Odra Marves, Axe Howul, and Colt Cobain, being the first new Crownsguard appointed since the original five.
