# Session
This session will be another downtime session amongst the party members, including the new addition of Vouhi Cliffer.

## Encounters
- Zero vs. Dorban and Thoss.
- Emil vs. Blackrock

### Player Subplots
#### Claude
- Begin studying at the University, taking [[Planes and Dimensions]], [[Algebraic Thinking]], and [[Foundational Writing]].
Â - After going home and preparing for school, Claude will notice an item in his bag that he did not remember packing. Within it is going to be a vial of fey essence, collected by Dvita off of Blark.|
- Fey Vial: drinking this will send Claude into a wild magic frenzy, which he will struggle to maintain control over Dvita. Typical Wild Magic effects, and wicked flashbacks of his past life (Beautiful Fey City, Wildfires, Chambers, Chains, etc).|
- Going to begin feeling really sleepy at night, despite getting his designated trance. Time also stops adding up. During this time, Dvita will have been scouting out the Western District, and Dvita can notice this by the mud on his boots or the unlocked window. Dvita has been slowly awoken since the Old Stones, and will continue to do research before acting on anything.|
- Xavier will also be gone for some of the downtime, as he has chosen to go into work voluntarily after hearing the news. The MPMP could use his help, and he's happy to if it means getting rid of these cultists. Claude can get up to shenanigans while home alone.|
- Claude will be approached by Ealdrid, and offer his condolences for any tragedy he may have faced.|
- Claude will be noticed by his friends from the university as well, and will also find Leif.
#### Emil
- Begin studying at the University, taking [[Planes and Dimensions]], [[Algebraic Thinking]], and [[Foundational Writing]].
- Eventual interacting with Von Jax, lead researcher in Detricite Amplicite Dynamics. He will show great interest in the arm, and will tell him that it is definitely the work of his great * 7 grandfather, Professor Jare Jax, denoted by the OBVIOUS j on the right pointer finger, as seven was his lucky number. 
- "Do you know what separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom? Us being general humanoids by the way, not just humans. I'm far too intelligent to be racist. What makes us humanoids different, what makes us civilized, is combination of our curiosity, and our undying resolve to find the answers to our questions. It is through the endless pursuit of knowledge that we will find strength. Nothing more, nothing less. And as such, I will help you find the answers to your question as well, so long as you help me answer mine."
- Dr. Jax wishes to put Emil through various tests using his arm. He claims that he has bonded to his quite well, and will explain that there is in fact a bonding process within the stone. There is biology, yes, but there seems to be spirit as well. That is the one thing his ancestor did not consider, because the concept of a soul in itself was outside the reach of his scientific mind. Then that begs the question, why. 
- Emil will learn that his arm was made around the Emergent Era, briefly after the defeat of Gnoxrus. He will ask if he knows anything about Carlos for a head start. He will conclude that this was made for a man named Carlos Brawhon, who became Crownsguard in the year 1750, after choosing to fight after the Battle of the Unbounding where he lost his arm. He succeeded as the second generation of Crownsguard after the death of Kyle Smith due to old age. He eventually fought alongside a Firbolg man named Seraphius, who is still alive and retired to the Claystone Mages to the North who may have more answers.
- Additionally, Emil will have an encounter with the Blackrock family, after the revival of the Loxodon he killed. During a late night on campus, he will notice a weird tug on his watch. It will come unclamped, and as it falls, a Leonin man runs after it, snatching it, and runs throughout campus into a back corner of campus.
- He will be cornered by 3 Thugs who are eager to take Emil out for what he did to their warehouse. [[Blackrock Mage]], [[Blackrock Thief]], [[Blackrock Thug]].
- Mage: 21/21 AC13
- Thug: 45/45 AC15
- Thief: 23/23 AC16
- If they win, they will steal Emil's Money and bash in his shield.
#### Tova
- If visiting Thaddeus, he will learn of his recent affairs.
- The shop will be messy, and the lights will be dim. Despite being in working hours, the closed sign will be up, along with a sign posted - "NEW HOURS" cutting his opening in half. Upon entering, he will proclaim his great satisfaction to see Tova still alive. Looking around the room, there will be indeterminant sketches of cryptic things, but Tova will have came just in time for a breakthrough.
- "You see, Amplicite has many interesting properties we have yet to discover the meaning of. It's relation to the mind, the body, the spirit. But one thing thorough testing has shown is this." 
- Thaddeus will pull out a raw node he has collected himself. With a dash of blood, he will place it next to a pot with a seed in it. A very subtle growth ill take place.
- "You see boy, the default form of this energy is life. Through inscription, mages have learned to channel that spunk into things like fire or electricity. And engineers have honed that to invention. But one thing society has found Amplicite incapable of doing is harnessing the necromantic. It goes against its fundamentals, the core of its essence. Yet, this happens."
- Thaddeus will pull out a small segment of another brick. If Tova asks, he went back to the explosion site, and found a fragment of a brick in a bush. All of the other pieces seemingly disappeared.
- "I will removed the inscription from this brick. Its instructions, essentially. Now while we could use standard Amplicite, via its fire properties, to create an explosion, yes, but there was something worse I had noticed. Too much so. The explosions at the commencement, they were terribly devastating on the body. The remains, I had watched them almost wither away. Now you could argue the heat was strong enough, but the smell was nothing like anything I have ever experienced before."
- Placing the brick piece next to the plant, instead of blooming, it will wither.
- "I'm telling you Tova, there is something happening here. Something unique, and something dangerous. I don't know who these people are, but I've heard the rumbling from here. You mean to tell me another detonation went off during this trial? Something is in motion here, and I will be damned if I let it continue without a second look. I don't know what this means admittedly... but it is no coincidence."
- As for Tova's new thinking, Thaddeus will admit to having little control over the programming of his thinking. He will tell him a bit of his past in anticipation for his exit.
- "You Tova, well, you were quite special. I'm not sure how much you remember, but I really didn't have much time to program you at all. You see, I had stumbled into your homeland all those months ago, a scared wee gnome man, confronted with what your locals called the floor dwellers. Wicked monsters of horrid proportions. You see, you come from a kind called Asteralis Golems, sentient trees made of an amazingly resilient bark. It is said you were born from the goddess of the region, Drysalia the Barkweaver. Despite being sentient, you were never really conscious. None of you were. Beings of protection, that is what they are. You were the one who had rescued me, actually. It's quite ironic actually. You took quite the beating from that wretched beast, but you carried me up to the invisible canopy with ease. I stood before the Verdant Assembly pleading for a place to stay to return home. Shockingly enough, they complied with the first half, but denied the second. You see the region is a bit of a secret to most of the world, and they did not want secret getting out. Well, I'd be damned to leave this shop behind, so I did what I did best. I tinkered! I was stuck out in your parts after getting stranded on the wrong side of the Chasms, and I had heard rumors of a beautiful region to the west of the mountains, so I went there for refuge. I had no idea. Regardless, I had a chunk of Amplicite on me, and my toolbox. So, I got to work. I created a core of the material, and by tricking you into believing implanting it in your chest was to save my life, you had let me. You lit up like fireworks, and you began to think. Oh the millions of questions you asked me. Well, we fled together. Your strengthened form worked wonders in escaping, and then, we became best friends. It was your idea, actually, to change your form to this one. You said it was more gentle, and you would get less stares. Long story short, I never really did invent  your way of thinking. That is all you my boy."
#### Vouhi
- Continue his second semester at the University, taking [[Algebraic Thinking]], [[Foundational Writing]], and [[Pescatarian Delights]].
- Will get a visit from [[Lysander Oragonis]], checking in on his studies and the start of the new semester. He will also seek to talk to him about the trial, and what he saw. Lysander will mention the tragedy of the Needlework Nexus, and that he frequented it.
- Before he leaves, Lysander will hand Vouhi a flyer to an event. The event will be held in the university banquet, and is a presentation on Morellus for international students.
#### Zero
- Zero will get a letter from Taxidus that says only the following:
- "Madran has been defeated. Will keep you updated on the situation. They will stay safe."
- Zero will be visited by [[Grunhilda Blackwood]], Juggah's estranged wife. She will be delivering bad news to Zero, as her husband's body has finally been found. She will show up on the doorstep of the bar at roughly 6:00PM, and the crowd will hush as she enters, knowing what has happened. She will ask to talk to Zero alone.
- "They found him. Just a few miles out from the University. His body was fresh, they said. Couldn't have been gone for more than a day. Its been 37 days Zero (he left three days after commencement). Thirty seven days he was alive out there, doing god knows what. Whatever it was, I'll bet you the most he was stubborn the whole time. But I know him, I know that man well. Whatever it is, I know it was something right. "
- "I just wish they never showed me the body. I know its procedure to confirm and whatnot but, the state he was in Zero, I've never seen him like this. To imagine such a big man seem so small. He was frail. I wonder how little he had been eating. And this terrible scarring crawling up his shoulder. It's all I could see the whole walk here. Damn those two for ruining my image of him. Damn them for all their snotty questions and remarks. I'm a grieving woman Zero. And all they wanted to know about was some damn letter."
- "It's all they asked me about. Apparently it was important for some lead or something? I don't know, frankly I don't care. Whatever it was, you two must have been real close. When they showed me the letter, pushing and pressing and panzying on about it... well it was addressed to you. I was going to keep reading but... but then I felt his stare. They were both plain clothes officers, but something about the one in the back really threw me off. He hardly spoke, he just, watched. But with such intent it made me feel sick. Those bastards have no idea how to deal with a grieving woman. I wonder how routine this is for them. Ask for their lead and let the widows wander their way. Whatever it was, it seemed important to them. Far more important than taking it easy on a woman who last her husband. They told me only a few hours ago. I had thought to wait until closing hours to come, but I don't think I could stay awake that long. You know, I gave up for a moment Zero. I thought that he was gone. I mean most would after that long. I stopped hanging posters. I went from doing something just to holding on hope. All while I know he was out there, fighting for us. It is just loss after loss, and he wanted to bring us home a win for once. That's why he was participating in this god awful messed up ritual anyways. I just can't help but feel like this is my fault."
- Outside of the window, a few buildings down, Thoss will be standing, giving Zero a wave. If Zero follows him, he will run about a minute and a half away into an alley, which will collapse beneath Zero's feet, and leaving him in the catacombs.
- He will be able to escape due to a trail of napkins, used by Juggah to trace his way out. After escaping the catacombs, 6 days will have passed.

- In the center mess hall, similar to the Student Union, there will be many students gathering around. Large signs saying First Year Students will direct the students to the hall within the CAS building. Within these halls are intricate artifacts and paintings of realms beyond our own. They will be greeted by an Elvish woman, who will be conducting their orientation. After the concession is full, the doors close, cutting off the line and sending them elsewhere.
- In a similar manner to the commencement ceremony, attendees will check in by pricking their finger upon entry, and receiving a blank card with a material similar to an ID. When the card turns green, they are to follow a group leader. Everyone will be called but roughly 250 students in this pod.
- "So, just a quick sanitization check, all of you here are competitors right? Theres no need to conceal it, I just want to make sure our detection ran smooth. Any final calls? Alright so, here's the deal. When the crown announced the Crucible, it was a shock to the world. Unfortunately it was a shock to us faculty members too, so moving forward, we're going to be instituting a new curriculum for members within the crucible based on some of the mistakes we had noticed from the end of last semester. The changes here are as follows"
- "First, the usual 20 days on 5 days off rule won't apply this semester, as that pattern resulted in some people missing time to compete and falling behind, especially during finals week. Instead, competitors will have a 4 day a week schedule, rather than the previous 2-3 day. Classes will run from 10:00-4:00 Solara to Terrador."
- "Second, your five days off will be every 25 days, and will be during the crucible instead. To recuperate your time off that is missed, 3 days before the trial and two days afterwards, classes will be cancelled for crucible members. This will be time to prepare and/or recover from the events of trials and align properly with your participance and the curriculum."
- "Third, after discussion with the Council, a motion has been put forth to alter curriculum for the contestants as they claim you all to be the future of our nation. As such, you all have received nothing short of the best in terms of professors and exclusive class sections marked by a T code, and have extended resources available to you all as students that others do not. As a side note, I suggest you all take advantage of these as much as possible"
- "Last but not least, removal from the trial through loss will result in a revoking of these privileges, and will result in a transition of scheduling to normal class sections as our curriculum is standardized and will make the transition largely smooth."
- After the presentation, the IDs of the students will instead turn purple, signifying their status as Crucible Students. These IDs are faceless, unless held up and presented, showing the name of the candidate, their 8 digit ID, and a bright green glow. If anyone other than the candidate presents the card, it turns red.
- Floating pieces of papers will then loftily float through the venue to each student, gravitating towards their ID. These are their schedules. They will continue through the rest of their schedules for the remainder of the day.

##### Summary
[[D&D/Player View/Session Summaries/Session 10 Summary |Session Summary]]
### Tunneling
- Within the Archives of the Trove, Emil and Tova will find a poorly drawn map of the sewer systems of Morellus. It will be hundreds of years old, and these will be the original maps of the Liberation Army. Every 10 minutes or so, the lines will appear to be different, moving at the blink of an eye. This will be a map to the catacombs beneath Morellus, and perhaps a chance of finding Zero.
- Potential avenues of excavation include a university job board, where they may find an architect of sorts. They may also deep dive into learning how to do this themselves, which will require at least 24 hours of rigorous bookkeeping to avoid doing damage to zeros bar
![[TheBrokenBarstool.excalidraw]]
- During the excavation process, they will not actively hit a tunnel.
