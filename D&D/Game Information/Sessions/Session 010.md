- In the center mess hall, similar to the Student Union, there will be many students gathering around. Large signs saying First Year Students will direct the students to the hall within the CAS building. Within these halls are intricate artifacts and paintings of realms beyond our own. They will be greeted by an Elvish woman, who will be conducting their orientation. After the concession is full, the doors close, cutting off the line and sending them elsewhere.
- In a similar manner to the commencement ceremony, attendees will check in by pricking their finger upon entry, and receiving a blank card with a material similar to an ID. When the card turns green, they are to follow a group leader. Everyone will be called but roughly 250 students in this pod.
- "So, just a quick sanitization check, all of you here are competitors right? Theres no need to conceal it, I just want to make sure our detection ran smooth. Any final calls? Alright so, here's the deal. When the crown announced the Crucible, it was a shock to the world. Unfortunately it was a shock to us faculty members too, so moving forward, we're going to be instituting a new curriculum for members within the crucible based on some of the mistakes we had noticed from the end of last semester. The changes here are as follows"
- "First, the usual 20 days on 5 days off rule won't apply this semester, as that pattern resulted in some people missing time to compete and falling behind, especially during finals week. Instead, competitors will have a 4 day a week schedule, rather than the previous 2-3 day. Classes will run from 10:00-4:00 Solara to Terrador."
- "Second, your five days off will be every 25 days, and will be during the crucible instead. To recuperate your time off that is missed, 3 days before the trial and two days afterwards, classes will be cancelled for crucible members. This will be time to prepare and/or recover from the events of trials and align properly with your participance and the curriculum."
- "Third, after discussion with the Council, a motion has been put forth to alter curriculum for the contestants as they claim you all to be the future of our nation. As such, you all have received nothing short of the best in terms of professors, and have extended resources available to you all as students that others do not. As a side note, I suggest you all take advantage of these sas "
