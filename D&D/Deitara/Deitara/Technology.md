The average technological proficiency of the world is similar to industrial revolution in the United States and Europe. To get a good idea of where technology and civilization is at, I will list common things that do or don't exist in the world. There is also the addition of some steampunk-like technology as well.

**THINGS THAT DO EXIST IN DEITARA**
- Steam engines (very rudimentary trains)
- Maritime technology (ships)
- Low accuracy firearms (muskets, flintlock pistols, revolvers)
- Basic hygiene (showers, toilets, sewage)
- Packaging technology (sealing things for transportation/expiration)
- Very simple, but inefficient electricity (consider lighting)
- Man-powered transportation
- Presence of both assembly lines and agriculture
- Rudimentary medicine (Gauze, ointments, germ theory)
- Steampunk Technology (parachutes, gliders, and airships for very few)

**THINGS THAT DO NOT EXIST IN DEITARA**
- Advanced communications technology (no TVs or phones, only radios in upper-class homes)
- Personalized vehicles (no cars)
- Modern Weaponry (no targeted explosives, automatic weaponry, etc)
