## Mythology

Atrax is envisioned as a cosmic sentinel, presiding over the forces that bind and balance the universe. Ancient myths depict Atrax as a star-born entity, cloaked in a mantle of shimmering darkness, with eyes that reflect the cosmos. Legend has it that Atrax was born from the primal chaos that predated creation, embodying the fundamental forces that draw all matter together. Temples dedicated to Atrax are often built at the confluence of ley lines or in places of natural magnetic anomalies, believed to be points of his divine influence.

## Worship

Worship of Atrax is particularly popular among astronomers, engineers, and lovers. His followers believe that understanding the natural pull between all things leads to greater harmony in the universe. Rituals often involve the use of magnets or gravitational experiments to symbolize life's inherent attractions and repulsion. Festivals occur during astronomical events like eclipses or planetary alignments, which are seen as manifestations of Atrax's power.

## Power

As a Greater deity, Atrax possesses immense control over gravitational fields, magnetic forces, and all forms of attraction, from the physical to the metaphysical. He can manipulate the weight of objects, the pull between souls, and even the tides of fate. His followers claim that he influences the bonds of love as much as he governs the stars in the sky.

## Symbolism

Atraxâ€™s symbols include the infinity loop, representing the endless interaction of forces, and iron filings, which align in patterns to reveal unseen forces at work. His sacred animal is the raven, a creature that is said to navigate by magnetic fields during its long migratory journeys.
