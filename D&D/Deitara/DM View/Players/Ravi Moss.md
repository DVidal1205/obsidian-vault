A Corvum from Arkaelia that worships Dentra due to vivid dreams, despite these being completely coincidental and unrelated to Dentra. All they want to do is serve Dentra and study the arts that Polithea has.

# DM Notes
Give Ravi some goofy dreams, but some of them should be wrong in the wasteland. They need to have doubt about Dentra, and some of them should put them in bad spots.
