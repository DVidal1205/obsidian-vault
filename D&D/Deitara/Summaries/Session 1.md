# Session 1 Summary
## Misogynist and the Bear
- After making it back to the bar in Polithea, the party is confronted by an misogynistic Elvish man seemingly looking for the Sacrina the party is carrying.
- After tossing Ravi 15 feet in the air, he flees after having Dissonant Whispers cast on him.
- The gravity guy is swiftly eaten by a Thunder Bear, who consumes his Sacrina. Alice convinces him not to eat the party, but learns very little as he is quite stupid.
## Bernarheim
- The party travels back to the library with Asteri eager to enter the restricted section, only to find a malnourished Vedalken man named Bernarheim, who reveals that he has been forcefully given an Athanea Sacrina, and she does not let him leave the library.
- He tells the party of the crystals, also known as Sacrina, which are small pieces of fallen gods. Consuming them can bring power or misfortune, and shows the party a formula with water and a metal cup to test if a Sacrina is safe or not.
- Bernarheim reveals to the party that Polithea is now very dangerous, since most of the Sacrina appear there, likely tied to the rumor that Polithea is the birthplace of the gods.
- He lets the party seek refuge in the restricted area overnight, where Asteri finds a Mortem tomb written in an unknown language, and Ravi gets a dapper new cloak.
- Lastly, he informs the party of the New Dawn, a refuge in the wasteland that takes people in. He wishes he could go there himself, and gives the party a compass given to him by New Dawn priests on how to get there.
## Thorned Dreams
- The party, with the exception of Alice, wake up in a dream. They stand in an infinite blue plane with a 50 foot Sacrina floating in the center. Peering into the reflection of the crystal, they saw themselves altered.
	- Asteri was fully gray and cracked, rather than just by her legs.
	- Evie was missing a horn
	- Ravi was wearing an eye patch
- Meanwhile, Alice was being consumed slowly by the Sylvanus Seed that was collected on the Sentinel Mission. After chipping off some roots and bark, it is revealed that there is a green Sacrina within the root. Ravi collects it. Some leftover roots climb into Alice's nose and ears.
## The Journey
The party promptly leaves the library, saying farewell to Bernarheim and offering him their thanks (food). Throughout a 3 day journey, the party witnesses:
- An immensely vast and hot desert
- A wild magic bog (where the party tripped balls)
- An invisible wolf, which Asteri swiftly fucking demolishes
- Ephara's Enchanters, a traveling circus, which enchants Evie's bagpipes with the Ephara crest.

The session ends with the arrival at the New Dawn.
