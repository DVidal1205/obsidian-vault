# Session 0 Summary
## Opening
- First of the party to be introduced was Ravi Moss, awaking from a weird dream of a woman with long platinum blonde hair, who was revealed to actually be a skeleton. Odd. They then decide to go to the library to study.
- At the Library, Asteri was introduced after getting in a commotion with a Sentinel guarding sensitive materials she wanted access to. After causing several scenes, she leaves. Ravi notices her long platinum blonde hair, and is intrigued. They follow her.
- After Asteri's familiar, a small Yorkie, notices Ravi following her, they get into a small tussle. After having Viscious Mockery hurled at them, Ravi flees with a "CAW." Asteri goes home and mourns her dead boyfriend, while Ravi heads to the bar.
- Near the bar, Evie charms the crowd with her unfortunately good bagpipe skills. Ravi joins in, and breaks it down. They are now bonded for life.
- Entering the bar, Asteri tries getting a shot of Dragon's Piss, said to "have you so fucked up, you'll awake cuddled up next to a scaly dragon in its den the next morning," before noticing Ravi and Evie walking in.
- The party sits next to Hanlen, before a cat hops into a chair. Transforming out of Wild Shape, Alice introduces herself with a "sorry I'm late."
## The Quest

- Hanlen tells the party that his coworker Bob has quit after being a doomer. In an effort to recruit more people, the higher ups within the Sentinels have been putting out these quests, hoping to get people excited about the work and join the Sentinels. Their numbers have dwindled since the Divine War.
- Handing a nice big scroll of jobs, Hanlen tells the party they've got 500 gold to their name, as long as they complete it. He then tells the party about these strange glowing crystals, and that they make you crazy. If they see one, they should bring it back to him.
## Gorvik's Godly Goblin Goods

- The party arrives at the first quest, a task to retrieve a scroll known as the Arbopher, from a little goblin man named Gorvik. The shop is a mess and he refuses to help, so Asteri casts charm person on him.
- Captivated by Asteri, Gorvik very willingly helps find the scroll in a matter of minutes. However, he still asks for a steep 250 gold for it. Asteri tries to woo him over, but even with her charm spell on him, there is nothing more Gorvik loves than gold.
- Ravi commands Gorvik to halt, giving Evie a window of opportunity to grab the Arbopher and flee. Gorvik didn't really seem to notice, instead he was googly eyes at Asteri. The party leaves, and he tells Asteri to "come back soon" with a sly wink. She is grossed out.

## Small Town, Big Tree
![[Tree.png]]
- For their next quest, the party arrives at a town in need of assistance. Peering over the city is a massive tree, destroying the local town. Standing in sorrow, Joanne tells the party that she requested the help of the Sentinel, and that her husband went missing.
- Around back of the cave, the party enters the bellows of the bark, first falling 120 feet to their deaths, before Evie promptly saves them with a Feather Fall spell. The party then goes through a series of unfortunate challenges. With the help of the Arbopher, they follow the correct path through the maze of the tree innards.
	- Evie turns into a potted plant, and Asteri grows 2 more arms after eating the freaky berries.
	- Asteri convinces a tree guardian she seeks adventure!
	- Everyone hops over some tangled roots except Asteri, who teleports through them in style.
	- Evie vaults over a chasm spaced with branches elegantly.
	- Ravi, Asteri, and Alice coordinate saving John, Joanne's husband, who fell to the bottom of the chasm.
- At the end, there is a massive seed, which Evie retrieves with a hard tug. The tree begins to ravel itself back into the seed, undoing all of the damage caused in the process. The party emerges from the ground victorious, and the 35 person population of this town applauds them.
## Sons of Sylvanus
- As it turns out, the seed was planted there on purpose. A cultist reveals himself as a Son of Sylvanus, and claims he will replant the world tree and turn this world into the home of his deity. However, he will quickly learn that these 4 random quest takers are not to be messed with.
	- The party gets ready to fight, and the second Son of Sylvanus, a large wood-skinned man, joins the fight.
	- Evie casts Tasha's Hideous Laughter, sending the first cultist into a fit of hysterical laughter.
	- Ravi bludgeons the back of the bark-skinned berserk with a spiritual weapon, creating an opening for Alice, who used a flame sword to cut straight through its head.
	- Evie turns the first cultist into a kebab wit h her rapier, allowing Asteri to follow up with an Eldritch Blast, blowing him into a mist of red and dirtying Evie with blood.
- The town once again celebrates, except for the poor Halfling man who lost his house again due to the big berserk.
## The Final Quest
![[Bob.png]]
- For their last task, the party enters a secluded region of the forest, finding an odd looking Cathedral, with a clock tower attached. As they approach, they notice the hand of the clock skip, and the rain drops freeze in mid air before falling again.
- Inside of the Cathedral, they encounter a small gnomish man with a big fluffy mustache, Bob, who was Hanlen's previous coworker. He is holding a big crystal, and claims that its telling him that it was there just for him. The party attempts to disarm him.
- After talking to Bob for a minute, Evie sends fear directly into his mind, hoping he will drop this crystal. Unfortunately, this causes him to panic more, jabbing the crystal straight into his chest, absorbing it. 
- Floating into the air, Bob begins to crumble and die, with half of his body aging rapidly and the other returning to infant form. The doors of the cathedral swing shut and lock themselves. His cracked form projects light on the cathedral walls, and shows the following visions.
	- A barren wasteland
	- A large encampment with 5 large pillars
	- A circle of hooded figures
	- Two symbols sliding and colliding with each other
	- Four figures surrounding a man
	- A large bear
- Then, Bob dies, dropping this strange crystal, and the party carefully retrieves it, wrapping it in a sleeping bag. They leave, and return back to Hanlen to retrieve their reward.

## When Are We?
- The party exits the Cathedral, only to see that it is the middle of the night. When looking up to determine the time, they notice there is now 3 moons instead of 1. No biggie, they head back into town. Unknowingly to the party, Alice feels a weird sensation of being watched.
- As they begin to pass some of the outer towns of Polithea, they notice that some of the buildings have collapsed. Furthermore, the dirt path they walked into the forest is almost completely grown over. Concerned, they continue to trek towards the city, only to find house after house completely crumbled.
- Making it back to the innards of the city, it also has suffered the same fate. Frequent skeletons of humanoids sit against ruins, and in blood or ash, the following phrases are written on the walls of the buildings
	- YOUR GODS ARE A LIE
	- THEY ABANDONED US
	- Deity crests, completely tarnished
	- One of the two symbols the party saw in the vision
- As the party stares at the rubble of Polithea, Alice feels the sensation of being watched return strongly.
