The presence of gods and the divine is hard to miss in Deitara (as the name so openly suggests). Deities of all shapes, sizes, and scopes dictate the way the world of Deitara operates. From something as narrow and abstract as poetry, to something as broad and concrete as the mountains, there is a divine being representing every single component of this world. 

# Organization and Hierarchy
Each Deity has a domain that it represents, and the extent of its power reflects the scope of its domain. For example, the deity of Light will be much stronger than the deity of Forging, as light is a much larger and stronger force. Each deity is separated into 5 different tiers: Lower, Upper, Great, Greater, and True. As mentioned previously, Deities are placed into tiers based on their domain. In the case of Light and Forging, the Deity of Light may be a Greater or True Deity, whereas the Deity of Forging would be considered Lower of Upper.

# Power and Worship
Beyond just their domains, Deities receive power based on the size of their worshiping body. For example, Amatera the Sun Goddess is one of the most powerful Deities, as she represents the domain of the Sun and held a massive following all throughout history. With that being said, Deities are able to be demoted and promoted through the ranks based on their following. Thus, the Deities also have the best interest of mortals in mind as winning them over will make them stronger and more fulfilled (there are exceptions to this).

Deities also indirectly receive power through the practice/use of their domains. In the case of Brevis, the God of Poetry, he receives power from all poets in the world, not just those who worship him. However, it should be noted that directly worshiping a god provides much more enhancement to the god than only practicing their domain. There is no correct way to worship a deity, and many receive power in unexplained ways. Some contact the mortal realm with the most optimal worshiping methods, others sit back and relax.

Worship of a certain deity also has stronger effects if a large percentage of worship occurs in close proximity, and results in many temples evolving to full communities.

# Discovery and Documentation
Since there are so many gods contained in the Deitaran Pantheon, it is impossible to say for certain how many there are. However, historians have been able to find unique traits and identifiers for most deities, which helps citizens determine if a divine event has occurred from a formerly known god.

Deities also have been known to make direct contact with mortals through psychic messaging, extra planar contact, or miracles, however these are still quite rare.
