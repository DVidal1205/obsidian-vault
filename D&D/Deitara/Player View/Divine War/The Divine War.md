The Divine War is the present conflict in the planet of Deitara, and has been undergoing for nearly 5 decades since its declaration in 1679. This war is between the five of the six grand nations of Deitara: Arkaela, Druvina, Meridia, Technoran, and Eldor. Only the region of Polithea remains unscathed in the war due to its sacrilege. Each of these five nations have been in conflict after conquering most of the world, leaving the only opportunity for expansion being to conquer neighboring territories.

Each of these nations has access to 2 [[The Deities|True Gods]], and thus, are extremely powerful. Establishing themselves on the power of these True Gods is what led to these nations winning in territorial dominance in the establishment of Deitaran civilization. Each nation also employs the help of many other gods, each of varying tiers and quantity, but most are irrelevant for the sake of the war.

# Polithea, the unscathed 
The region of Polithea is seen as the emergent region of the people of Deitara, said to have been home to the very first civilizations created by the gods. Polithea has no formal governmental structure, and thus, it has little impact in the affairs of the Divine War. Furthermore, due to its sacrilegious position, few nations dare to attempt to conquer Polithea. Despite its lack of governmental status, many still call Polithea home in the modern day, most of its residents being priests or experts at a trade/craft that pays homage to a god.
